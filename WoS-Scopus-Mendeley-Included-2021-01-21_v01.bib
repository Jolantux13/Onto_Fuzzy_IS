abstract = {A philosophical formalism of a new methodological aspect of humanistic systems design and evaluation is given. A requisite concept of context-dependency is highlighted, and some approaches to fuzzy sets and linguistics subsequently extended. It is consequently shown that a mathematical theory of pragmatic fuzzy subsets is not only conceptually possible but practically implementable in man-machine studies as well. Thus, the important context-dependent implication of the subjective nature of Zadeh's theory of fuzzy sets can be better exploited. As a pragmatic theory, the approach here is a seeming connection between pragmatism and ontology, concepts that are traditionally diametrically opposed to each other. The attitude adopted has been the equation of pragmatism and psychophysical measurements of ontological objects (noumena). Pragmatism is tacitly defined as a form of empiricism whereby linguistic constructs (i.e., linguistic-variable denotions) that represent any aspect(s) of a humanistic system are nothing more than an operational procedure used to achieve psychophysical measurements of the aspect(s). In this fashion, pragmatism would enable the contents of assertions, which are made through declarative propositions, about humanistic systems to be deciphered within relevant contexts. For pragmatism, direct sense experience provides both the meaning and the criterion of reality judgements. The context-dependent nature of the physical reality of ontological entities is, therefore, better understood pragmatically vis-a-vis the appropriate evaluative criteria and interpretative conventions. By emphasizing the distinction between a fuzzy system (naturally fuzzified) and a fuzzified mathematical structure (meta-mathematically fuzzified), the use of the standard fuzzy topologies is justified although it is conceptually possible to develop a yet more general topology or perhaps an alternative one especially in the case of a meta-mathematically fuzzified structure. However, for the express purpose of machine implementation, a naturally fuzzified system, such as a (complex) humanistic system, is more amenable to an initial test of the philosophy of pragmatic fuzzy subsets. Consequently, the fuzzy topology and spaces employed are intended to be devoid of extensive generalities, in this instance. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a composite software environment, termed Toolkit, for supporting the design and development of Knowledge Based Systems in the domain of Industrial Automation. It presents the design of the tools and the motivation behind them, and the supporting methodology that allows generic problems to be associated with the functionality provided by the respective tools. The Toolkit allows both empirical and theoretical knowledge to be represented, the latter by an implementation of qualitative modelling techniques based on a component-centred ontology. Further, languages are provided for representing (empirical) knowledge in either a declarative or a procedural format. The Toolkit is organized as a task-dependent architecture consisting of five conceptual layers: strategic, tactical, teleological, functional and object. The tools are defined by a systematic task classification and are constructed from a set of tool components consisting of the representation languages and their associated inference mechanisms. In addition, other tool components include the provision of truth maintenance and causal ordering. An overview of the representation languages is given together with a description of the current tools of the Toolkit. An example is given of using two of the tools to build a model-based diagnostic reasoner, using the component based language, and constraint propagation and assumption-based truth maintenance. Finally, a discussion of the current work on the Toolkit is presented. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {The capture of design rationale in terms of the process and product
quality requirements for a software system from different perspectives
in concurrent engineering poses two challenges: (1) process and product
quality requirements arising from different perspectives usually
conflict with each other; and (2) both process and product quality
requirements are often vague and imprecise. Recent research into methods
for handling software quality requirements has taken one of two
approaches-quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative approaches are
based upon software metrics and specify requirements using predicate
logic. Qualitative approaches represent requirements qualitatively and
decompose the requirements into a hierarchy of subrequirements. A
unified approach for specifying and analyzing requirements
quantitatively and qualitatively is also developed based on fuzzy logic.
However, none of these methods addresses design rationale capture based
on integrated analysis of both product and process quality requirements
from multiple perspectives in concurrent software development. In this
paper a formal framework is developed for an integrated analysis of
software process and product quality requirements to support design
rationale capture from multiple perspectives in concurrent software
development. It provides a top-down approach for decomposing vague,
complex quality requirements based upon an ontological model of a
perspective, and a bottom-up approach for analyzing inter-requirement
relationships from multiple perspectives. A feature-based approach for
assessing the impact of design alternatives on both process and product
quality requirements from multiple perspectives is developed by
explicitly documenting the effects of design options on design features
and the effects of design features on quality requirements. The
techniques described by the framework are illustrated using a
distributed order processing system.},

@article{ISI:000186332300016,
abstract = {Information overload is a problem at an individual and a corporate
level. Many solutions have been proposed, including knowledge
management, data warehouses, service directories and digital libraries.
The semantic Web aims to unify many of these approaches by appropriate
markup and agreement on the meaning of the markup. At the individual's
level, these techniques partially solve the problem by classifying
documents within hierarchical structures and enabling searching and
browsing of the documents. However, they also contribute to the problem
as there is no unique categorisation and access structure that suits
every individual. Finding the right document becomes a two-stage process
- first find the right place in the categorisation scheme, then find the
document within that class.
In addition to enterprise-wide sources, individual information sources
include e-mails, electronic documents in many formats, personal and
group filespaces, notes, diary entries, etc. These are unlikely to
conform to the enterprise categorisation but form useful resources
nevertheless.
The idea of an intelligent personal hierarchy for information (iPHI) is
to auto-configure access to multiple sources of information based on
personal categories. This entails fuzzy matching of meta-data structure
as well as content. Metadata is a powerful tool in intelligent
information management; however, it is not necessarily uniform, either
in label or in content. One document's `author' is another's `creator';
`John Smith', `Smith, John' and `J. Smith' all refer to the same
individual but are syntactically different.
Fusion ( or intelligent integration) of information takes place in an
environment where the data may be of varying quality, and some may be
incomplete or inconsistent. Combining metadata ( and the associated
data) is not possible without knowing ( or learning) the mappings
between their ontologies. Such mappings are likely to be soft, i.e.
approximate - different sources arise from different designers with
different world views. Soft computing is vital to tackle these problems.
Frequently, data sources are organised implicitly, according to an
internal ontology or taxonomy. Knowing this ontology or taxonomy is a
necessary first step to using it in the fusion process. The work
described in this paper extracts the implicit taxonomy and enables a
user's interaction with the data ( e. g. searching) to be expressed in
their preferred terms rather than those used by the system.},

abstract = {An Ontology-based Fuzzy Event Extraction (OFEE) agent for Chinese e-news
summarization is proposed in this article. The OFEE agent contains
Retrieval Agent (RA), Document Processing Agent (DPA) and Fuzzy
Inference Agent (FIA) to perform the event extraction for Chinese e-news
summarization. First, RA automatically retrieves Internet e-news
periodically, stores them into the e-news repository, and sends them to
DPA for document processing. Then, the DPA will utilize the Chinese
Part-of-speech (POS) tagger provided by Chinese knowledge information
processing group to process the retrieved e-news and filter the Chinese
term set by Chinese term filter. Next, the FIA and Event Ontology Filter
(EOF) extract the e-news event ontology based on the Chinese term set
and domain ontology. Finally, the Summarization Agent (SA) will
summarize the e-news by the extracted-event ontology. By the simulation,
the proposed method can summarize the Chinese weather e-news
effectively. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

ASDL provides a specification of publishing and requesting services for agents, and matchmaking is the process of finding an appropriate service for a request through a medium. In this paper, a possibilistic Petri net-based agent service description language (PPN-ASDL) is proposed as an advanced ASDL with four key features: possibilistic transitions to represent a service or a request; input places to denote preconditions expected to hold before performing the services, output places to denote postconditions expected to hold after performing the services; and possibility and necessity measures to quantify the confidence levels that an agent can provide the relevant service for a request. A matchmaking mechanism, permitting a relaxed match for close semantics, is also developed to search for the possible services among agents for a request. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

logic methods are of great interest in many GIS applications, however
the traditional fuzzy logic has two important deficiencies: first, to
apply the fuzzy logic, we need to assign, to every property and for
every value, a crisp membership function and second, it does not
distinguish between the situation in which there is no knowledge about a
certain statement and a situation that the belief to the statement in
favor and against is the same. In order to solve these problems, we
motivate to use intuitionistic fuzzy logic. This paper gives fundamental
concepts and properties of an intuitionistic fuzzy spatial region. We

abstract = {In the setting of possibility theory, a tool named ``fuzzy pattern
matching{\{}''{\}} (FPM) has been proposed in the eighties, and then
successfully used in flexible querying of fuzzy databases and in
classification. Given a pattern representing a request expressed in
terms of fuzzy sets, and a database containing imprecise or fuzzy
attribute values, the FPM returns two matching degrees. Namely, for each
item in the base, the possibility and the certainty that it matches the
requirements of the pattern are computed. In multiple-source information
systems, attribute values are often assessed in linguistic terms
belonging to different vocabularies. The request itself, which may
include preferences, may be expressed using terms of another vocabulary.
The paper proposes a counterpart of FPM, called ``Qualitative Pattern
Matching{\{}''{\}} (QPM), for estimating levels of matching between a request
and data expressed with words; words can be related together through a
qualitative thesaurus or ontology, where approximate synonymy and
specialization relations are encoded. Given a request, QPM rank-orders
the items which possibly, or which certainly match the requirements,
according to the preferences of the user. The proposed approach is based
on a qualitative assessment of matching degrees which does not
necessarily require the use of numerical scales. Its merits for dealing
with information querying in face of heterogeneous sources of
information are advocated. Application to the handling of textual data
in information retrieval is also outlined.},

In the proposed system the cases can be expressed in terms of attributes that can be crisp as well as fuzzy and appropriately similarity scores are computed. The cases can have attributes from a vocabulary, which can be defined with the constraint of global commitments so that the attributes can be shared and interpreted in a distributed setting. We have implemented a knowledge sharing protocol with common ontology as the repository of exchange vocabulary for knowledge sources with different Universe of Discourses (UOD). We have developed a shell for tailored application development in different domains.

Based on this framework, the proposed approach considers configuring as: (i) coalition formation and (ii) product and resource allocation tasks in multi-agent environment. To solve the configuring task, an application of different techniques of soft computing is examined. The first approach permits to find sub-optimal solution applying the theory of games with fuzzy coalitions. In this case, genetic algorithms (GA) are used to find solutions of the game. The second approach uses: (i) genetic algorithms directly and (ii) constraint satisfaction problem solving for resource allocation task. Ontologies codified as object oriented constraint networks are used for task description and decomposition. A multi-agent test-bed based on FIPA compliant agent platform is developed and used to conduct the experiments. The above techniques are compared and the simulation results are discussed.},

abstract = {To effectively use and exchange information among AI systems, a formal specification of the representation of their shared domain of discourse'called an ontology'is indispensable. In this article we introduce a special kind of knowledge representation based on a dual view of the universe of discourse and show how it can be used in human activities such as searching, in-depth exploration, and browsing. After a formal definition of dualistic ontologies, we exemplify this definition with three different (well-known) kinds of ontologies, based on the vector model, on formal concept analysis, and on fuzzy logic, respectively. The vector model leads to concepts derived by latent semantic indexing using the singular value decomposition. Both the set model as the fuzzy set model led to Formal Concept Analysis, in which the fuzzy set model is equipped with a parameter that controls the fine-graining of the resulting concepts. We discuss the relation between the resulting systems of concepts. Finally, we demonstrate the use of this theory by introducing the dual search engine. We show how this search engine can be employed to support the human activities addressed above. {\textcopyright} 2005, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

interoperability problem is caused by differences in data semantics, for
example heterogeneous land use/land cover classification systems. A
critical review of an existing method for semantic interoperability

modified framework based on conceptual spaces and rough fuzzy sets. Land
cover categories are defined by a set of defining attributes formally
represented as a collection of rough fuzzy membership functions and
importance weights. This parameterized representation is used to
translate between the US Natural Vegetation Classification Standard and
the European CORINE Land Cover system based on evaluations of different
aspects of semantic similarity between categories. The results
demonstrate that the use of different similarity metrics in a conceptual
space, together with the explicit rough fuzzy uncertainty
representation, increases the semantic separation between land cover
categories. Diagrams and maps illustrate the information that can be
gained from the semantic similarity assessment. These developments open
new possibilities to explore semantic relationships between concepts,
both within a classification and between classifications used in

In this paper LOS representations of gene product data are presented to both crisp and fuzzy clustering algorithms. We demonstrate how fuzzy partition matrices generated by Non-Euclidean Relational Fuzzy c-Means (NERFCM) clustering led to the discovery that two gene products in GPD19412.10.03 might not be properly annotated in the ENSEMBLE database. Revisiting the database, we found that the gene products in question had been reannotated since the initial sampling date (12/10/2003). Our examples also illustrate the ability of NERFCM to extract clusters that seem apparent in visual displays of the LOS dissimilarity data. These examples demonstrate the potential of fuzzy clustering for automation of knowledge discovery in gene product databases.},

Automated reasoning with ontologies and categories had been discussed in

represented, but embodied knowledge, which is learnt by doing, applied
by self-organization, and understood by bodily interacting with (social)
environments. In a complex world, we have to be able to act and decide
with incomplete and fuzzy knowledge under the conditions of bounded
rationality. The bounded rationality of embodied minds is a challenge of
informatics especially in the complex information world of Internet
applications and Web-based services offering access to a vast variety of

database which gathers information about the behavior of pathogenic

not available; data are heterogeneous because they come from various
sources (scientific bibliography, industrial data, etc); data may be
imprecise because of the complexity of the underlying biological
processes that are involved. To deal with heterogeneity, MIEL queries
the database through several views simultaneously. To query incomplete
data, MIEL proposes to use a fuzzy set, expressing the query preferences
of the user. Fuzzy sets may be defined on a hierarchized domain of
values, called an ontology (values of the domain are connected using the
a kind of semantic link). MIEL also proposes two optional
functionalities to help the user query the database: i) MIEL can use the

abstract = {Objectives: The technology of grid services is developing fast. This
paper presents an approach to the implementation of an intelligent grid
service that configures a hospital taking advantage of the knowledge
logistics idea.
Methods: The presented approach is based on synergistic integration of
knowledge acquired from distributed sources in order to obtain new or
complement insufficient knowledge. Presented approach uses ontologies
and the formalism of object-oriented constraint networks for knowledge
representation and applies ILOG to constraint-based problem solving.
Results: The application of the approach is illustrated via a decision
support system for a fictitious case study of a hospital configuration
in the Binni region. The system showed the ability to produce
interrelated solutions for subtasks of the hospital configuration task
based on the built ontology and input parameters. Besides, such
preferences as cost or time minimization are also considered by the
implemented fuzzy logic module that finds a feasible solution.
Conclusions: KL would benefit from the grid, and particularly from the
concept of a semantic grid. The scalable architecture of the approach
enables its extension with regard to knowledge/information sources
number and, thereby, with regard to factors taken into account during
complex problem solving. Utilizing ontologies allows integration of the
approach into existing processes and facilitates knowledge sharing with
similar systems. Application of constraint networks allows rapid problem
manipulation and usage of such existing efficient technologies as ILOG.},

the fuzzy ontology. Every fuzzy concept has a set of membership degrees
associated with various events of the domain ontology. In addition, a
news agent based on the fuzzy ontology is also developed for news
summarization. The news agent contains five modules, including a
retrieval agent, a document preprocessing mechanism, a sentence path
extractor, a sentence generator, and a sentence filter to perform news
summarization. Furthermore, we construct an experimental website to test
the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the news agent

The proposed approach considers configuring as a sequence of interrelated tasks, from which, partner selection among available enterprises and resource allocation are described in details. These tasks are solved within the framework applying different techniques of computational intelligence: (i) the theory of games with fuzzy coalitions, (ii) genetic algorithms, and (iii) constraint satisfaction problem solving.

abstract = {Lean manufacturing has been a topic of considerable interest in manufacturing for the past few years. It is now widely acknowledged that organizations that have mastered lean manufacturing methods have substantial advantage in terms of cost and quality over those still practising traditional mass production. Value stream mapping (VSM) provides a systematic way for the implementation of lean manufacturing philosophy. It consists of a range of mapping tools for the identification of the various types of waste occurring in different manufacturing stages. The selection of an appropriate mapping tool for the identification of waste at a macro- and microlevel in the manufacturing system is a complex decision-making problem. In this paper, a fuzzy-based multipreference, multicriterion, and multiperson decision-making heuristic has been developed to resolve the problem of such magnitude. A case study of the steel industry has been taken into account. Here, a hierarchy related to the decision problem has been developed and is resolved by a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The underlying issues pertaining to implementation of lean philosophy and decision-making procedures are considered, with reference to mathematically validated methods available in the literature. {\textcopyright} IMechE 2006.},

abstract = {In this paper, an intelligent image retrieval system that adopts XML technology is presented. The system allows high-quality museum images and associated information to be made available over networks. Image retrieval systems become more important and popular because of the increased demands on these systems. Traditionally, the retrieval process has been implemented using content-based image retrieval (CBIR) that relies on retrieving stored images from a collection by comparing low level features (binary form) that are automatically extracted from the images themselves. Other attempts considered high-level features using pattern matching techniques. Recent attempts have adapted semantic ontology and matadada languages. We, however, noted that case-based reasoning is more efficient and of great benefit in this area. This is mainly because users both in indexing and retrieval processes, tend to use old cases by associating images that reveal similar features. In this work, we present an application of our integrated approach to image indexing and retrieval. The underlying technique uses high-level features to find the most possible assignment to the presented image description. It applies fuzzy reasoning to convert the quantitative attributes into qualitative terms for indexing and retrieval. To facilitate the storage and retrieval, we adopted XML technology.},

abstract = {Word based searches for relevant information from texts retrieve a huge collection and burden the user with information overload. Ontology based text information retrieval can perform concept-based search and extract only relevant portions of text containing concepts that are present in the query or those that are semantically linked to query concepts. While these systems have better precision of retrieval than general-purpose search engines, problems arise with those domains where ontological concepts cannot be unambiguously described using precise property descriptors. Besides, the ontological descriptors may not exactly match text descriptions or the user given descriptors in query. In such situations, uncertainty based reasoning principles can be applied to find approximate matches to user queries. In this paper we have presented a framework to enhance traditional ontological structures with fuzzy descriptors. The fuzzy ontology structure has been used to locate and extract both precise and imprecise descriptions of concepts from Web documents and then store them in a structured knowledge base. The design of the structured knowledge base, which in our case is a database, is also derived from the underlying fuzzy ontology representing the domain. User queries are processed in two stages. In the first stage, precise SQL queries are formulated and processed over the knowledge base to find a possible answer set. In the second stage, fuzzy reasoning is applied to compute the relevance of the answers in the answer set with respect to the query. We have provided experimental validation of the approach through knowledge-extraction and query processing executed over a diverse set of domains. {\textcopyright} 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract = {Background: Integration of heterogeneous data types is a challenging problem, especially in biology, where the number of databases and data types increase rapidly. Amongst the problems that one has to face are integrity, consistency, redundancy, connectivity, expressiveness and updatability. Description: Here we present a system (Biozon) that addresses these problems, and offers biologists a new knowledge resource to navigate through and explore. Biozon unifies multiple biological databases consisting of a variety of data type (such as DNA sequences, proteins, interactions and cellular pathways). It is fundamentally different from previous efforts as it uses a single extensive and tightly connected graph schema wrapped with hierarchical ontology of documents and relations. Beyond warehousing existing data, Biozon computes and stores novel derived data, such as similarity relationships and functional predictions. TheBirkland, A., {\&} Yona, G. (2006).

Sophisticated methods of query that span multiple data types were implemented and first-of-a-kind biological ranking systems were explored and integrated. Conclusion: The Biozon system is an extensive knowledge resource of heterogeneous biological data. Currently, it holds more than 100 million biological documents and 6.5 billion relations between them.

Approximation spaces used for concept approximation have been initially
defined on samples of objects (decision tables) representing partial
information about concepts. Such approximation spaces defined on samples
are next inductively extended on the whole object universe. This makes
it possible to define the concept approximation on extensions of
samples. We discuss the role of inductive extensions of approximation
spaces in searching for concept approximation. However, searching for
relevant inductive extensions of approximation spaces defined on samples
is infeasible for compound concepts. We outline an approach making this
searching feasible by using a concept ontology specified by domain
knowledge and its approximation. We also extend this approach to a
framework for adaptive approximation of vague concepts by agents
interacting with environments. This paper realizes a step toward

Furthermore, cut concepts are extended into comparison cut concepts in FCDLs to represent comparison expressions between fuzzy membership degrees, which are often used in practice but not supported by the other fuzzy extensions of description logics. FCDLs have more expressive power than FDLs and EFDLs, and are able to represent expressive fuzzy knowledge and to perform reasoning tasks based on them. Therefore, FCDLs can enable representation and reasoning for fuzzy ontologies with expressive fuzzy knowledge on the semantic web.},

abstract = {The growing interest and expanding efforts oriented to create metadata associated to Web resources represents an opportunity for new models of information seeking that use highly-structured metadata records as a navigation affordance. In this context, Semantic Web technology provides formal languages for the description of metadata and for the linking of such metadata elements to shared conceptualizations called ontologies. Ontologies can be used to implement user seeking moves that support different search strategies, according to Bate's concepts. Nonetheless, many user moves require the consideration of some degree of imprecision or uncertainty that is either attributable to the ontology structure in itself or to the interpretation of the selections associated to the move by the system as a query criteria. This paper describes a collection of such fuzzy moves as a generic meta-model for the design of fuzzy concept browsers, extending previous research on ontology-based information seeking. In addition, a concrete design is provided as an illustration of the range of possible interaction designs. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {In multiple-source information systems, attribute values are often assessed in linguistic terms belonging to different vocabularies. The request itself, which may include preferences, may be expressed using terms of another vocabulary, raising the problem of matching the query and the information in a semantic manner. The fuzzy pattern matching framework allows us to compute matching degrees between queries and data represented by fuzzy sets, even if they do not perfectly match. The qualitative pattern matching no longer requires a fuzzy set representation thanks to the use of ontologies for computing similarity degrees between terms. This allows us to deal with information querying in face of heterogeneous sources of information.

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a technique for extracting patterns to a XML data flow; then, we show how such patterns can be developed into an ontology of classes. Also, we discuss the impact of different fuzzy representation techniques for XML data on the outcome of our procedure. One might wonder why all this is needed, since the semantics of XML data could in principle be satisfactorily represented via their associated XML schemata ComplexTypes. Unfortunately it turns out that standard XML schema definitions need to cover a wide repertoire of possible attributes. For this reason, optional elements are widely used, thus decreasing the expressiveness of XML schemata as descriptors of the content of single instances. Our approach relies on comparing fuzzy encodings of XML fragments. This comparison will allow us to define "typical" sets of attributes, that we shall consider hints to possible meaningful classes. Then, we shall evaluate fuzzy overlapping between candidate cluster heads in order to define a tentative class hierarchy. Our fuzzy modelling assumes that a domain expert has associated an importance degree in the [0, 1] interval to vocabulary elements (i.e. tag names). As we shall see in the remainder of the paper, this burden is not excessive, since this importance assessment only needs to be carried out once, looking at the schema. At run time, each incoming XML fragment is mapped into a fuzzy set whose elements are the tag names [3]. Each element membership is computed by aggregating the vocabulary importance values of the tags lying on the path from it to the root. The topology of the individual XML tree is modelled by using an aggregation that takes into account nodes nesting level or nodes occurrence. Our procedure consists of the following steps. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer.},

abstract = {The actual "Version" of the World Wide Web is surely one of the most important achievements of the last decades. But it suffers from the intrinsic deficit to include the semantic structure of the offered information or knowledge as HTML was developed to format the content instead of describing the logical structure. While the actual research on semantic web and RDF offer improvements for this situation, it is likely that the problem will not be solved completely. This is mainly caused by the fuzziness of human language and the fact that the boundaries of ontologies cannot be defined exactly. This article shows a description and a general methodology based on fuzzy inference in order to close this gap. The usage of fuzzy logic allows it to represent and process ambiguous facts making it possible to reconstruct the fuzziness of the real world and human way of thinking. Based on this representation and ability of processing it, better search algorithms can be developed and implemented in order to gain better results. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

matching subsystem for color descriptions will certainly facilitate web
applications in the domains concerned, such as image retrieval, clothing

exploitation of ``deeper{\{}''{\}} semantics to bridge the semantic gap. What
with the inherent variability and imprecision characterizing color
naming, this paper proposes a novel approach for defining (1) the fuzzy
semantics of color names on the HSL color space, and (2) the associated
measures to evaluate the similarity between two fuzzified color
descriptions. The experimental results have preliminarily shown the
strength of the deeper semantics surpassing the ability of both keywords

artificial cognitive agents equipped with means for recognizing states
of external objects and language signs. Each concept is created in the

communication. This communication makes it possible to correlate

Under the proposed approach, ontologies are used to capture general,
spatial, and contextual knowledge of a domain, and agenetic algorithm is
applied to realize the final annotation. The employed domain knowledge
considers high-level information in terms of the concepts of interest of
the examined domain, contextual information in the form of fuzzy
ontological relations, as well as low-level information in terms of
prolotypical low-level visual descriptors. To account for the inherent
ambiguity in visual information, uncertainty has been introduced in the
spatial relations definition. First, an initial hypothesis set of graded
annotations is produced for each image region, and then context is
exploited to update appropriately the estimated degrees of confidence.
Finally, a genetic algorithm is applied to decide the most plausible
annotation by utilizing the visual and the spatial concepts definitions
included in the domain ontology. Experiments with a collection of
photographs belonging to two different domains demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Approaches to document classification belong to two major families:
similarity-based (crisp) classification methods and neural networks
(gradual) ones. For gradual techniques, a major open issue is
controlling search space dimension. While similarity-based methods
identify clusters based on the same number of variables used for
document encoding, neural networks automatically identify variables that
cause distinctions among clusters. Therefore, the variables' number may
vary depending on the documents structure and content, and is difficult
to estimate it a priori. This paper proposes a hybrid classification
method suitable for heterogeneous document bases like the ones commonly
encountered in business and knowledge management applications. Our
method is based on an evolutionary algorithm for tuning both neural
network's structure and weights. While searching the optimal neural
network's configuration it is possible to determine the minimal number

Minimum operator; whereas this paper proposes a multiple-resolution

resolves those difficulties. Furthermore, the proposed method
facilitates multiple-resolution analysis, so it can examine how results

fuzziness is the result of allowing more accurate weighted annotations

abstract = {Fuzzy logic and soft computing have important roles to play in the development of the semantic web. Ontologies represent a means of representing and sharing knowledge between users and systems, and are important tool for information retrieval. However many different ontologies have been established, and communication between them can be difficult. In particular, many terms are located in multiple locations within large ontologies. Different stakeholders in the information retrieval process, “Authors”, “Readers” and “Librarians”, are identified. This work deals with the concept of the “Fuzzy Ontology”, which is designed to allow the representation of differing viewpoints within a single framework. The means of constructing, refinement and use of the fuzzy ontology are described. Fuzzy ontology membership values can be learned from documents or users, based around existing ontologies such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Use of the fuzzy ontology approach for information retrieval may allow the efficient sharing of knowledge between users and groups.},

abstract = {Semantic Web, as extension of the current one, promises to provide more automated services based on machine-processable semantics of data and heuristics that make use of metadata. A key challenge of the Semantic Web is the adaptation of Web contents according to web parameters, ontologies, dictionaries. Processing metadata scalability involves infrastructures to interpret, translate and convert different metadata languages automatically. In addition, contextual information and user exigencies should also be considered to assure flexible and proactive interaction. The emergence of sharing semantic knowledge moves towards comfortable reuse of knowledge (thanks to the availability of metadata dictionaries) and machine-processable semantics of data, (through agent-based services, middleware applications, ontology-based system). In this sense, benefits of garnering information come from middle-way services (brokering, matchmaking assistance) aimed to enable more interoperability among heterogeneous approaches. This work is based on a web service infrastructure for semantic-based information discovery. Through techniques of fuzzy clustering, human comprehensible information (relevant metadata) are captured from an RDF-oriented collection of machine-readable documents, in order to support semantic navigation into the Web that is very heterogeneous space, in terms of languages, dictionaries and ontologies. This approach proposes a semantic RDF-oriented classification of documents as prerequisite for a suitable characterization of relationships between concepts and web resources.},

abstract = {Most of information retrieval (IR) approaches relies on the hypothesis that keywords extracted from a document are sufficient to evaluate the relevance of that document with respect to the query. Such an approach may insufficiently lay bare the semantic contents of the documents. In addition to keywords, automatic indexing methods need external knowledge such as thesauri and ontologies for improving the representation of documents or for expanding queries to related keywords. Moreover, ontologies may be combined with a view of for estimating the relevance of documents, the "proximity" between words, or for expressing flexible queries. In this chapter, we survey several recent approaches. Then, two types of methods are discussed in detail. The first one uses a symbolic pattern matching approach, which is based on possibilistic ontologies (where qualitative necessity and possibility degrees estimate to what extent two terms refer to the same thing). The second type of approaches projects fuzzy set representations of queries and documents on a classical ontology, and compare these projections for rank ordering the documents according to a retrieval status value. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Finally, the tableau algorithm is developed for the reasoning in the vague ALC. The vague ALC based on vague set uses two degrees of membership instead of a single membership degree in the fuzzy sets and is more accurate in representing the imprecision in the degrees of membership. The vague ALC has more expressive power than ALC and can represent fuzzy knowledge and perform reasoning tasks based on them.

new standards appear very promising as candidates to support a new
generation of virtual organisations. Whilst knowledge can be represented

from the semantic web are applied to define a virtual state space of a

their skills and local knowledge in a community. A task initiator, with
a virtual sensor to perceive the advertised skills and with an adaptive
belief model about the community, seeks for the best matched partners
for cooperation. The belief model is a fuzzy neural network based on
Adaptive Resonance Theory which takes the advertisements of actors as
its initial belief and learns actors' actual capabilities through
interaction experience. Dynamic alliances can then take place in an
automated/semi-automated way that exhibit adaptive ability,
self-organisation, unsupervised learning and competition ability. The
alliances thus exhibit the inherent characteristics of realistic

Additionally, a visual context representation and analysis approach is
presented, blending global knowledge in interpreting each object
locally. Contextual information is based on a novel semantic processing
methodology, employing fuzzy algebra and ontological taxonomic knowledge
representation. In this process, utilization of contextual knowledge
re-adjusts labeling results of semantic region growing, by means of
fine-tuning membership degrees of detected concepts. The performance of

Situational computing can be viewed as the pervasive computing paradigm that deals with situational context representation and reasoning. One important problem that arises in such paradigm is the imperfect observations (e.g., sensor readings) that lead to the estimation of the current user situation. Hence, the knowledge upon which the context/situation aware paradigm is built is rather vague. To deal with this shortcoming, we propose the use of Fuzzy Logic theory with the purpose of determining (inferring) and reasoning about the current situation of the involved user. We elaborate on the architectural model that enables the system to assume actions autonomously according to previous user reactions and current situation. The captured, imperfect contextual information is matched against pre-developed situation ontologies in order to approximately infer the current user context. Finally, we present a series of experimental results that provide evidence on the flexible, efficient nature of the proposed situational computing.},

abstract = {The semantic interpretation of images can benefit from representations
of useful concepts and the links between them as ontologies. In this
paper, we propose an ontology of spatial relations, in order to guide
image interpretation and the recognition of the structures it contains
using structural information on the spatial arrangement of these
structures. As an original theoretical contribution, this ontology is
then enriched by fuzzy representations of concepts, which define their
semantics, and allow establishing the link between these concepts (which
are often expressed in linguistic terms) and the information that can be
extracted from images. This contributes to reducing the semantic gap and
it constitutes a new methodological approach to guide semantic image
interpretation. This methodological approach is illustrated on a medical
example, dealing with knowledge-based recognition of brain structures in
3D magnetic resonance images using the proposed fuzzy spatial relation

abstract = {Informal settlements behave very dynamical over space and time and the number of people living in such housing areas is growing worldwide. The reasons for this dynamical behavior are manifold and are not matter of this article. Nevertheless, informal settlements represent a status quo of housing and living conditions which is from a humanitarian point of view in the most cases below acceptable levels. Therefore, reliable spatial information about informal settlements is vital for any actions of improvement of these living conditions. Since remote sensing data is a well suited data source for mapping and monitoring we demonstrate a methodology to detect informal settlements (favelas) from QuickBird data using an object-based approach. On the one hand we therefore use experiences and adapt them which were already made by Hofmann, P. (2001) regarding the image segmentation of an IKONOS scene of Cape Town. On the other hand we resort to a general ontology of informal settlements which we then transfer to a fuzzy-logic rule base which acts as basic classifier of the generated segments. This basic rule base is than extended in a way that features of segregation given by the ontology (namely neighbour hood) are applied to the extraction method as an iterative process (i.e. a knowledge based region growing). Finally, we assess the results of the simple and iterative method by comparing them with the results of a manual mapping. {\textcopyright} 2008, Springer Berlin Heidelberg. All rights reserved.},

@article{Sheehan2008,
abstract = {Background: Various measures of semantic similarity of terms in bio-ontologies such as the Gene Ontology (GO) have been used to compare gene products. Such measures of similarity have been used to annotate uncharacterized gene products and group gene products into functional groups. There are various ways to measure semantic similarity, either using the topological structure of the ontology, the instances (gene products) associated with terms or a mixture of both. We focus on an instance level definition of semantic similarity while using the information contained in the ontology, both in the graphical structure of the ontology and the semantics of relations between terms, to provide constraints on our instance level description. Semantic similarity of terms is extended to annotations by various approaches, either though aggregation operations such as min, max and average or through an extrapolative method. These approaches introduce assumptions about how semantic similarity of terms relates to the semantic similarity of annotations that do not necessarily reflect how terms relate to each other. Results: We exploit the semantics of relations in the GO to construct an algorithm called SSA that provides the basis of a framework that naturally extends instance based methods of semantic similarity of terms, such as Resnik's measure, to describing annotations and not just terms. Our measure attempts to correctly interpret how terms combine via their relationships in the ontological hierarchy. SSA uses these relationships to identify the most specific common ancestors between terms. We outline the set of cases in which terms can combine and associate partial order constraints with each case that order the specificity of terms. These cases form the basis for the SSA algorithm. The set of associated constraints also provide a set of principles that any improvement on our method should seek to satisfy. Conclusion: We derive a measure of semantic similarity between annotations that exploits all available information without introducing assumptions about the nature of the ontology or data. We preserve the principles underlying instance based methods of semantic similarity of terms at the annotation level. As a result our measure better describes the information contained in annotations associated with gene products and as a result is better suited to characterizing and classifying gene products through their annotations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Sheehan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Learning and maintaining ontologies play critically important roles in the Semantic Web. Ontologies provide formal and explicit semantics to available knowledge and make possible shared understanding of a domain. A great deal of knowledge in the Semantic Web involves different sorts of imprecision. Common examples of imprecise knowledge include various statistical hypotheses, vagueness and ambiguities of natural language and many others. Consequently, ontologies must be expressive enough to handle imprecision. This paper presents an approach to formal handling of granularity as a special kind of imprecision in ontologies. It is based on Soft Computing techniques, in particular, Rough Set and Fuzzy Set theories. The approach also makes heavy use of Rough Mereology - a recently proposed paradigm for approximate reasoning - to compute degrees of imprecision of ontological concepts, relationships and assertions. It is demonstrated how the proposed mereological approach can be used together with the framework for representing uncertainty in Description Logic - family of popular logics for specifying formal ontologies. Finally, the paper introduces interval computations to the area of representing and reasoning with ontologies and shows how intervals can formally capture the imprecision incurred by computing rough inclusion (mereological) functions. {\textcopyright} 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

F-Logic is an ontology language which is also based on first-order logic, but classes and properties are modeled as terms rather than predicates. Our goal is to enable interoperation between predicate-based and F-Logic-based ontology languages. To this end, we define an intuitive translation from predicate-based ontologies to F-Logic ontologies and show that this translation preserves entailment for large classes of ontology languages, including most of OWL DL. Specifically, we define the class of equality-safe (E-safe) formulas, show that the Description Logic SHIQ is E-safe, and show that the translation preserves validity of E-safe formulas. We use these results to close the open problem of layering F-Logic programming on top of Description Logic Programs and we show that our results apply to HILOG, a syntactically higher-order, but semantically first-order language. Finally, we show that our results also apply to a meta-modeling extension for Description Logics (v-semantics).},

So far, RSS information is mostly managed by content publishers and Internet users have less initiative to choose what they really need. More attention needs to be paid on techniques for user-initiated information discovery from RSS feeds. In this paper, a quantitative semantic matchmaking method for RSS based applications is proposed. The semantic information of an RSS feed can be described by numerical vectors and semantic matching can then be conducted in a quantitative form. The ontology is applied to provide a common-agreed matching basis for the quantitative comparison. In order to avoid semantic ambiguity of literal statements from distributed RSS publishers, fuzzy inference is used to transform an individual-dependent vector into an individual-independent vector and semantic similarities can then be revealed as the result. {\textcopyright} 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

of positive and stratified fuzzy dl-prograrns coincides with their
canonical least model and iterative least model semantics, respectively.
We also provide a characterization of the canonical semantics of
positive and stratified fuzzy dl-programs in terms of a fixpoint and an
iterative fixpoint semantics, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a
reduction of fuzzy dl-programs under the answer set semantics to normal

semantic documents retrieval. After formally defining a fuzzy ontology
and a fuzzy knowledge base, a special type of new fuzzy relationship
called (semantic) correlation, which links the concepts or entities in a
fuzzy ontology, is discussed. These correlations, first assigned by
experts, are updated after querying or when a document has been inserted
into a database. Moreover, in order to define a dynamic knowledge of a
domain adapting itself to the context, it is shown how to handle a
tradeoff between the correct definition of an object, taken in the
ontology structure, and the actual meaning assigned by individuals. The
notion of a fuzzy concept network is extended, incorporating database
objects so that entities and documents can similarly be represented in
the network. Information retrieval (IR) algorithm, using an object-fuzzy
concept network (O-FCN), is introduced and described. This algorithm
allows us to derive a unique path among the entities involved in the
query to obtain maxima semantic associations in the knowledge domain.
Finally, the study has been validated by querying a database using fuzzy

are regarded as logically aggregated contexts. One important problem
that arises in such systems is the imperfect observations (e.g., sensor
readings) that lead to the estimation of the current context of the
user. Hence, the knowledge upon which the context/situation aware
paradigm is built is rather vague. To deal with this shortcoming, we
propose the use of Fuzzy Logic theory with the purpose of determining
(inferring) and reasoning about the current situation of the involved
user. We elaborate on the architectural model that enables the system to
assume actions autonomously according to previous user reactions and
current situation. The captured imperfect contextual information is
matched against predeveloped ontologies in order to approximately infer
the current situation of the user. Finally, we present a series of
experimental results that provide evidence of the flexible efficient

the automation of discovery, invocation and composition activities. The
semantic annotation is the ``add-on{\{}''{\}} to cope with the actual
interoperability limitations and to assure a valid support to the
interpretation of services capabilities. Nevertheless many issues have
to be reached to support semantics in the web services and to guarantee
accurate functionality descriptions. Early efforts address automatic

appropriately meet the consumer's demand. In the most of approaches,
this activity is often entrusted to software agents, able to drive

can be single or composed of more atomic services.
This paper presents a hybrid framework which achieves a fuzzy
matchmaking of semantic web services. Central role is entrusted to
task-oriented agents that, given a service request, interact to discover
approximate reply, when no exact match occurs among the available web
services. The matchmaking activity exploits a mathematical model, the
fuzzy multiset to suitably represent the multi-granular information,

abstract = {Computing with words introduced by Zadeh becomes a very important
concept in processing of knowledge represented in the form of
propositions. Two aspects of this concept approximation and
personalization - are essential to the process of building intelligent
systems for human-centric computing.
For the last several years, Artificial Intelligence community has used
ontology as a means for representing knowledge. Recently, the
development of a new Internet paradigm - the Semantic Web - has led to
introduction of another form of ontology. It allows for defining
concepts, identifying relationships among these concepts, and
representing concrete information. In other words, an ontology has
become a very powerful way of representing not only information but also
its semantics.
The paper proposes an application of ontology, in the sense of the
Semantic Web, for development of computing with words based systems
capable of performing operations on propositions including their
semantics. The ontology-based approach is very flexible and provides a
rich environment for expressing different types of information including
perceptions. It also provides a simple way of personalization of
propositions. An architecture of computing with words based system is
proposed. A prototype of such a system is described. (c) 2008 Published

Slim was created from GO to generate a highly aggregated report of the
human-genome annotation. We propose statistical methods to adapt the
general purpose, OBO Foundry Disease Ontology (DO) for the
identification of gene-disease associations. Thus, we need a simplified
definition of disease categories derived from implicated genes. On the
basis of the assumption that the DO terms having similar associated
genes are closely related, we group the DO terms based on the similarity
of gene-to-DO mapping profiles. Two types of binary distance metrics are
defined to measure the overall and subset similarity between DO terms. A
compactness-scalable fuzzy clustering method is then applied to group
similar DO terms. To reduce false clustering, the semantic similarities
between DO terms are also used to constrain clustering results. As such,
the DO terms are aggregated and the redundant DO terms are largely
removed. Using these methods, we constructed a simplified vocabulary
list from the DO called Disease Ontology Lite (DOLite). We demonstrated
that DOLite results in more interpretable results than DO for
gene-disease association tests. The resultant DOLite has been used in

One of the major issues in automation of cyberspace is the discordance between the concept people use and the elucidation of the corresponding data by existing algorithms. Moreover, the measurement and computation of relevance referred to as degree of match-making is a crucial task and presents one of the most important challenges in unknown and uncertain environments of multi-agent systems. Optimal algorithms that generate the best matches for a user input are desired. This paper overcomes the challenges listed by proposing an agent-based semantic match-making algorithm that addresses the problem of heterogeneous ontology at user end and semantically enhances the user-input. A degree of match-making evaluation scheme based on fuzzy logic is proposed and evaluated using synthetic data from the web.

The strength of association between two concepts determines the degree of association between the concepts.

extracting semantic views of text contents under the form of structured

to build kinds of fuzzily weighted structured images of semantic
contents. A preliminary step consists in identifying the different types
of relations (is-a, part-of, related-to, synonymy, domain, glossary
relations) that exist between the words of a text, using some general
ontology such as WordNet. Then taking advantage of these relations,
different types of fuzzy clusters of words can be built. Moreover, apart
from its frequency of occurrence, the importance of a word may be also
evaluated through some estimate of its specificity. A degree of
``centrality{\{}''{\}} is also computed for each word in a cluster. The size
of the clusters, the frequency, the specificity and the centrality of
their words are indications that enable us to build a fuzzy set of sets

representative of its contents. The ideas advocated in the paper and
their potential usefulness are illustrated on a running example and on

abstract = {In this article we discuss the problem of inferring threats in an urban
environment, where the knowledge of the environment involves multiple
types of intelligence and infrastructure data, and is by nature
uncertain or approximate. We use a collection of situation-aware agents
to infer potential threats in such environments, where agents are
responsible for event correlation and situation assessment. We review
the weaknesses of a current approach to threat assessment in Homeland
Security and then describe our agent-based approach. The key innovations
of our agent-based approach are: an ontological commitment to events and
situations, fuzzy event correlation, fuzzy situation assessment,
adaptability and learning during threat assessment operations, and an
enhancement of traditional belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents with
situation awareness. We describe the properties of situation-aware BDI
agents and discuss the implementation of them on a variety of BDI agent
platforms. Lastly, we discuss the interoperability of these platforms
and address the issue of scalability through coupling to large-scale
peer-to-peer overlays.},

trade-off between multiple objectives. The algorithm is not subject to

totally impossible, for instructors to read through and analyze the

The main contribution of this paper is the illustration of a novel

construct concept maps based on the messages posted to online discussion

Unlike traditional clustering methods, our method is capable of assigning genes to multiple clusters, which is a more appropriate representation of the behavior of genes. Two datasets of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression profiles were applied to compare our method with other state-of-the-art clustering methods. Our experiments show that our method can produce far better biologically meaningful clusters even with the use of a small percentage of Gene Ontology annotations. In addition, our experiments further indicate that the utilization of prior knowledge in our method can predict gene functions effectively.

It is quite important to analyze nutritional facts for foods eaten for those who are losing weight or suffering chronic diseases such as diabetes. This paper proposes a novel type-2 fuzzy ontology, including a type-2 fuzzy food ontology and a type-2 fuzzy markup language (FML)-based ontology, for diet assessment. In addition, we also present a type-2 FML (FML2) to describe the type-2 fuzzy ontology and the FML2-based diet assessment agent, including a type-2 knowledge engine, a type-2 fuzzy inference engine, a diet assessment engine, and a semantic analysis engine. In the proposed approach, first, the nutrition facts of various kinds of food are collected from the Internet and the convenience stores. Next, the domain experts construct the type-2 fuzzy ontology, and then the involved subjects are requested to input the different food eaten. Finally, the proposed FML2-based diet assessment agent displays the diet assessment of the food eaten based on the constructed type-2 fuzzy ontology. Using the generated semantic analysis, people can obtain health information about what they eat, which can lead to a healthy lifestyle and healthy diet. Experimental results show that the proposed approach works effectively where the proposed system can provide a diet health status, which can act as a reference to promote healthy living. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web, where information
would have precisely defined meaning, based on knowledge representation
languages. The current W3C standard for representing knowledge is the
Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL is based on Description Logics which is
a popular knowledge representation formalism. Although, DLs are quire
expressive they feature limitations with respect to what can be said
about vague knowledge, which appears in several applications.
Consequently, fuzzy extensions to OWL and DLs have gained considerable
attention. In the current paper we study fuzzy extensions of the
Semantic Web language OWL. First, we present the (abstract) syntax and
semantics of a rather elementary fuzzy extension of OWL creating fuzzy
OWL (f-OWL). More importantly we use this extension to provide an
investigation on the semantics of several f-OWL axioms and more
precisely for those which, in classical DLs, can be expressed in
different but equivalent ways. Moreover, we present a translation method
which reduces inference problems off-OWL into inference problems of
expressive fuzzy Description Logics, in order to provide reasoning
support through fuzzy DLs. Finally, we present two further fuzzy
extensions of OWL based on fuzzy subsumption and fuzzy nominals. (C)

abstract = {Human beings are seen as a problem solver, and the process follows the simple input-process-output. Thus having identified a decisional problem (input), will apply some rules of inference and problem solving techniques based on experience and cognitive abilities (processing) to deduce or arrive at some conclusion (output). Information is frequently defined as interpreted data. Juxtaposing with infological equation by Langefors, the importance of the interpreter becomes vivid in the process. Earlier on, we proposed an ontological framework for knowledge reconciliation in economic intelligence process. However, we noticed with deep concern that the various mental process shaping and constructing certain knowledge are difficult to comprehend and placed tangibly making it Fuzzy. This research work is based on the horrendous nature of the bi-valued logic (yes/no, true/false) inherently present in human attempt to inform. We therefore propose a new concept tagged Fuzzontology to assist in enhancing the interpretation of ambiguous meaning. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The web size is increasing continuously. Chinese researchers have shown that web growth obeys the Moor's law and the Internet will double in size every 5.32 years. The more the Internet is growing; the more tendencies the people have to use the search engines. Moreover, since most of the commercial search engines are based on keyword indexing, there are many records in their result lists that are irrelevant to the user's information needs. It is shown that for retrieving more relevant and precise results, the following two points should be concerned: First of all, the query (either it is generated by a human or an intelligent agent) should be expressed in an accurate and exact manner. Second, we should empower search engines with the ability to capture the semantic relation between the words and the query context. Hence, different search engine architectures, each of which containing query refinement or semantic understanding components, have been proposed. Each architectural model has its own specific properties; but, most of them focus on only one of the two points mentioned above to improve the overall system efficiency. Moreover, in existing architectures, query refinement components have direct interaction with users which may either take their time or threat their privacy while gathering basic information. In this paper, we proposed an improved architectural model for agent and ontology based search engine which uses domain ontology for semantic understanding and a query refinement subsystem based on fuzzy ontology. This subsystem helps Search Agents to refine their queries, express them in a more precise way and get more relevant results. The simulation result shows that using this query refinement subsystem by Search Agents can improve the system efficiency up to 5.2{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Managing temporal data in the relational environment keeping the imprecise and fuzzy nature of the data requires the extension of the relational model. Small numbers of extended models at conceptual level are proposed and there is no significant implementation of such model exists. Importance of developing ontological framework for imprecise data and temporal data is required in many applications such as health and patient databases. In this paper we propose a temporal fuzzy ontology for patient data in a hospital environment. On the basis of the ontology defined we propose a conceptual fuzzy temporal relational model (FTRM) for handling time varying attributes and fuzzy attributes in the relational database environment. The proposed model is easy to define, manage and incorporates the important and relevant features in the target fuzzy temporal relational model.},

Its idea is to find a degree to which, for instance, "most of the important individuals agree as to almost all of the relevant options". The fuzzy majority, expressed as fuzzy linguistic quantifiers (most, almost all, ...) is handled via Zadeh's [46] classic calculus of linguistically quantified propositions and Yager's [44] OWA (ordered weighted average) operators. The soft degree of consensus is used for supporting the running of a moderated consensus reaching process along the lines of Fedrizzi, Kacprzyk and Zadro{\.{z}}ny [3], Fedrizzi, Kacprzyk, Owsi{\'{n}}ski and Zadro{\.{z}}ny [2], Kacprzyk and Zadro{\.{z}}ny [22], and [24].

These linguistic summaries indicate in a human consistent way some interesting relations between individuals and options to help the moderator identify crucial (pairs of) individuals and/options with whom/which there are difficulties with respect to consensus.

abstract = {Ontology is an important part of the W3C standards for the Semantic Web, and how to quickly and cheaply construct Web ontologies has become a key technology to enable the Semantic Web. However, information imprecision and uncertainty exist in many real-world applications, thus constructing fuzzy ontology by extracting domain knowledge from fuzzy database models (e.g., fuzzy ER model) can profitably support fuzzy ontology development. In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing fuzzy ontology from fuzzy ER model, in which the fuzzy ontology consists of fuzzy ontology structure and instances. Firstly, we give the formal definition and the semantics of fuzzy ER models. Then, we introduce the fuzzy extension of ontology language OWL DL, i.e., fuzzy OWL DL. Based on the fuzzy OWL DL, a kind of fuzzy ontology called fuzzy OWL DL ontology is presented. Furthermore, we consider the fuzzy ER schema and the corresponding database instances, and translate them into the fuzzy ontology structure and the fuzzy ontology instances, respectively. Finally, since a fuzzy OWL DL ontology is equivalent to a fuzzy Description Logic f-SHOIN(D) knowledge base, how the reasoning problems of fuzzy ER models (e.g., satisfiability, subsumption, and redundancy) may be reduced to reasoning on f-SHOIN(D) knowledge bases is investigated, which will further contribute to constructing fuzzy OWL DL ontology that exactly meet application's needs. Of course, the correctness of the translation and reasoning problems are proved completely. {\textcopyright} 2010 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

focus more on the trust and knowledge contexts as key issues in
knowledge sharing. Trust is the most important issue when creating a
relationship, knowledge sharing and partnership. Moreover, there are a
number of forms that trust can take in these relationships and the most
regularly cited forms are competence and benevolence trust. In this
paper, we will explore these two forms of trust and will examine their
role in knowledge sharing and how they can be defined and measured. On
the other hand, we will apply ontologies to explore the knowledge
context. Ontologies are used in widespread application areas
particularly to provide a semantically shared domain knowledge in a
declarative formalism for intelligent reasoning. Even ontology enables
knowledge sharing; however, the complexity of knowledge being
conceptualized in the ontology is critical to the success of knowledge
sharing efforts. Other factors like trust in the source of knowledge can
also affect knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose metrics to
measure the complexity of ontology for knowledge sharing. Finally, the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge sharing methodology is presented
both using a fuzzy-inference engine and a crisp system.},

textual knowledge is accumulating in the biomedical literature. PubMed
is the most comprehensive database collecting and managing biomedical
literature. To help researchers easily understand collections of PubMed
abstracts, numerous clustering methods have been proposed to group
similar abstracts based on their shared features. However, most of these
methods do not explore the semantic relationships among groupings of
documents, which could help better illuminate the groupings of PubMed
abstracts. To address this issue, we proposed an ontological clustering
method called GOClonto for conceptualizing PubMed abstracts. GOClonto
uses latent semantic analysis (LSA) and gene ontology (GO) to identify
key gene-related concepts and their relationships as well as allocate
PubMed abstracts based on these key gene-related concepts. Based on two
PubMed abstract collections, the experimental results show that GOClonto
is able to identify key gene-related concepts and outperforms the STC
(suffix tree Clustering) algorithm, the Lingo algorithm, the Fuzzy Ants
algorithm, and the clustering based TRS (tolerance tough set) algorithm.
Moreover, the two ontologies generated by GOClonto show significant

abstract = {It has been widely pointed out that classical ontology is not sufficient
to deal with imprecise and vague knowledge for some real-world
applications like personal diabetic-diet recommendation. On the other
hand, fuzzy ontology can effectively help to handle and process
uncertain data and knowledge. This paper proposes a novel ontology
model, which is based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs), called
type-2 fuzzy ontology (T2FO), with applications to knowledge
representation in the field of personal diabetic-diet recommendation.
The T2FO is composed of 1) a type-2 fuzzy personal profile ontology
(type-2 FPPO); 2) a type-2 fuzzy food ontology (type-2 FFO); and 3) a
type-2 fuzzy-personal food ontology (type-2 FPFO). In addition, the
paper also presents a T2FS-based intelligent diet-recommendation agent
(IDRA), including 1) T2FS construction; 2) a T2FS-based personal
ontology filter; 3) a T2FS-based fuzzy inference mechanism; 4) a
T2FS-based diet-planning mechanism; 5) a T2FS-based menu-recommendation
mechanism; and 6) a T2FS-based semantic-description mechanism. In the
proposed approach, first, the domain experts plan the diet goal for the
involved diabetes and create the nutrition facts of common Taiwanese
food. Second, the involved diabetics are requested to routinely input
eaten items. Third, the ontology-creating mechanism constructs a T2FO,

abstract = {As cross-lingual information retrieval is attracting increasing
attention, tools that measure cross-lingual semantic similarity between
documents are becoming desirable. In this paper, two aspects of
cross-lingual semantic document similarity measures are investigated:
One is document representation, and the other is the formulation of
similarity measures. Fuzzy set and rough set theories are applied to
capture the inherently fuzzy relationships among concepts expressed by
natural languages. Our approach first develops a language-independent
sense-level document representation based on the fuzzy set model to
reduce the barrier between different languages and further explores the
fuzzy-rough hybrid approach to obtain a more robust macrosense-level
document representation through the partitioning of the integrated sense
association network of the document collection into macrosenses. Then,
Tversky's notion of similarity and the F1 measure on information
retrieval are adopted to formulate, respectively, two document
similarity measures with fuzzy set operations on the two proposed
document representations. The effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated by its success rate in identifying the English translations
to their corresponding Chinese documents in a collection of
Chinese-English parallel documents. Moreover, the proposed approach can
be easily extended to process documents in other languages. It is
believed that the proposed representations, along with the similarity
measures, will enable more effective text mining processes.},

diseases is provided at home, usually but not exclusively, after the
discharge of a patient from hospital. It is the purpose of the present
study to present the technical means which we have developed, in order
to support the adaptation of the continuity of care of cardiorespiratory
diseases at home.
Methods: We have developed an integrated system that includes: first, a
prototype laptop-based portable monitoring system that comprises
low-cost commercially available components, which enable the periodical
or continuous monitoring of vital signs at home; second, software
supporting medical decision-making related to tachycardia and
ventricular fibrillation, as well as fuzzy-rules-based soft-ware
supporting home-ventilation optimization; third, a typical continuity of
care record (CCR) adapted to support also the creation of a homecare
plan; and finally, a prototype ontology, based upon the HL7 clinical
document architecture (CDA), serving as basis for the development of
semantically annotated web services that allow for the exchange and
retrieval of homecare information.
Results: The flexible design and the adaptable data-exchange mechanism
of the developed system result in a useful and standard-compliant tool,
for cardiorespiratory disease-related homecare.
Conclusions: The ongoing laboratory testing of the system shows that it
is able to contribute to an effective and low-cost package solution,
supporting patient supervision and treatment. Furthermore, semantic web
technologies prove to be the perfect solution for both the
conceptualization of a continuity of care data exchange procedure and
for the integration of the structured medical data.},

abstract = {Recent rapid advances in Information and Communication Technologies
(ICTs) have highlighted the rising importance of the Business Model (BM)
concept in the field of Information Systems (IS). Despite agreement on
its importance to an organization's success, the concept is still fuzzy
and vague, and there is little consensus regarding its compositional
facets. Identifying the fundamental concepts, modeling principles,
practical functions, and reach of the BM relevant to IS and other
business concepts is by no means complete. This paper, following a
comprehensive review of the literature, principally employs the content
analysis method and utilizes a deductive reasoning approach to provide a
hierarchical taxonomy of the BM concepts from which to develop a more
comprehensive framework. This framework comprises four fundamental
aspects. First, it identifies four primary BM dimensions along with
their constituent elements forming a complete ontological structure of
the concept. Second, it cohesively organizes the BM modeling principles,
that is, guidelines and features. Third, it explains the reach of the
concept showing its interactions and intersections with strategy,
business processes, and IS so as to place the BM within the world of
digital business. Finally, the framework explores three major functions
of BMs within digital organizations to shed light on the practical
significance of the concept. Hence, this paper links the BM facets in a
novel manner offering an intact definition. In doing so, this paper
provides a unified conceptual framework for the BM concept that we argue
is comprehensive and appropriate to the complex nature of businesses
today. This leads to fruitful implications for theory and practice and
also enables us to suggest a research agenda using our conceptual
framework. European Journal of Information Systems (2010) 19, 359-376.

reasoner works in synergy with a fuzzy engine, which is in charge of
handling the vagueness of some conditions in the semantic rules,
computing a certainty degree for each inferred situation. These degrees
are used to rank the situations and consequently to assign a priority to
the resources associated with the specific situations. The application
of SARR to two real business cases is also shown and discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the use of the social concept `conviviality'
for computer science in general, and for the development of ambient
technologies in particular. First, we give a survey of the use of the
concept `conviviality' in the social sciences. Conviviality is usually
considered a positive concept related to sociability. However, further
analysis reveals a negative side related to lack of diversity, privacy
and ethical issues. Second, we argue that conviviality requirements for
ambient intelligence are challenging, because ambient technologies give
rise to a new virtual and social reality, and conviviality issues play a
central role in applications that are concerned with the interaction of
material, virtual and social realities. Conviviality highlights an
important challenge that we illustrate with examples that emphasize
ethical issues, such as privacy threats, surveillance of users and
identity theft. Intelligent interfaces, for example, allow instant
interactions and thereby create strong needs for coordination and
regulation mechanisms that have to be addressed to ensure the safeguard
of individuals against abuses, such as privacy intrusions and identity
manipulations. Third, we propose a conviviality ontology by
operationalizing the fuzzy concept of `conviviality,' such that it can
be used in computer science in the same way as other social concepts
such as `service,' `contract' or `trust' are used in this area.
Conviviality is defined using dependence networks, and tools for
conviviality are based on, what we call, conviviality masks. Fourth, we
illustrate how convivial ambient intelligence applications can be
designed using our operationalized concept of conviviality. We
illustrate our arguments and contributions with a running example on the
use of ambient technologies in digital cities, as a prototypical example
where material reality such as ambient technologies interacts with
virtual and social realities.},

However, concepts that are without clear boundaries or are vague in
meanings are abundant. Existing ontology models are therefore unable to
cope with many real cases effectively. In addition, with respect to a
certain category, certain objects can be considered as more
representative or typical, which are explained by cognitive
psychologists using the Prototype Theory of concepts. Based on this
theory, we propose a formal model for fuzzy ontologies. This model is
equipped with likeliness, the extent to which an object is considered as
an instance of a concept, and typicality, the representativeness of an
object in a concept. This model enables ontologies to model concepts and
bring the results of reasoning closer to human thinking. Our work is
based on an in-depth investigation of the limitations of existing models
and findings in cognitive psychology. The nature and differences between
likeliness and typicality are also thoroughly discussed. In addition, we
present a logic for the ontology model which is based on fuzzy
propositional modal logic.},

abstract = {As supply chains are becoming ever more global and agile in the modern
manufacturing era, enterprises are increasingly dependent upon the
efficient and effective discovery of shared manufacturing resources
provided by their partners, wherever they are. Enterprises are thus
faced with increasing challenges caused by the technical difficulties
and ontological issues in manufacturing interoperability and integration
over heterogeneous computing platforms. This paper presents a prototype
intelligent system SWMRD ( Semantic Web-based manufacturing resource
discovery) for distributed manufacturing collaboration across ubiquitous
virtual enterprises. Ontology-based annotation to the distributed
manufacturing resources via a new, multidisciplinary manufacturing
ontology is proposed on the semantic web to convert resources into
machine understandable knowledge, which is a prelude to the meaningful
resource discovery for cross-enterprise multidisciplinary collaboration.
An ontology-based multi-level knowledge retrieval model is devised to
extend the traditional information retrieval approaches based on keyword
search, with integrated capabilities of graph search, semantic search,
fuzzy search and automated reasoning to realise the intelligent
discovery of manufacturing resources, e. g. to facilitate more flexible,
meaningful, accurate and automated resource discovery. A case study for
intelligent discovery of manufacturing resources is used to demonstrate
the practicality of the developed system.},

abstract = {An increasing number of decision support systems based on domain
knowledge are adopted to diagnose medical conditions such as diabetes
and heart disease. It is widely pointed that the classical ontologies
cannot sufficiently handle imprecise and vague knowledge for some real
world applications, but fuzzy ontology can effectively resolve data and
knowledge problems with uncertainty. This paper presents a novel fuzzy
expert system for diabetes decision support application. A five-layer
fuzzy ontology, including a fuzzy knowledge layer, fuzzy group relation
layer, fuzzy group domain layer, fuzzy personal relation layer, and
fuzzy personal domain layer, is developed in the fuzzy expert system to
describe knowledge with uncertainty. By applying the novel fuzzy
ontology to the diabetes domain, the structure of the fuzzy diabetes
ontology (FDO) is defined to model the diabetes knowledge. Additionally,
a semantic decision support agent (SDSA), including a knowledge
construction mechanism, fuzzy ontology generating mechanism, and
semantic fuzzy decision making mechanism, is also developed. The
knowledge construction mechanism constructs the fuzzy concepts and
relations based on the structure of the FDO. The instances of the FDO
are generated by the fuzzy ontology generating mechanism. Finally, based
on the FDO and the fuzzy ontology, the semantic fuzzy decision making
mechanism simulates the semantic description of medical staff for
diabetes-related application. Importantly, the proposed fuzzy expert
system can work effectively for diabetes decision support application.},

This paper proposes a novel fuzzy geospatial ontology model, FGSO. In FGSO, the complex semantic of fuzzy spatial relations are described explicitly by a fuzzy spatial relation ontology which also carries out fuzzy spatial reasoning; a fuzzy geospatial ontology based on our new ontology language, FR-OWL, is developed to represent a variety of geospatial information besides spatial relations in a uniform format; a converting algorithm is developed to integrate these two ontologies to mine more information.

Robots are conceived like (semi-)autonomous systems able to explore and manipulate a portion of their environment in order to find and collect information and data. On the other hand, the Web, that in a robotic domain is usually considered like a channel of communication (e.g. tele-operation, tele-manipulation), here is conceived also like a source of knowledge. This allows to define a new framework able to manage robotic agents in order to get precise, real-time information from the real world. Besides, software agents may search for and get additional information from the Web logical world.

In order to reduce the traveler's cost of seeking accommodations, enforce the return ratio efficiency of guest rooms and enhance total operating performance, evaluating and selecting a suitable hotel location has become one of the most critical issues for the hotel industry. In this scenario, recommender services are increasingly emerging which employ intelligent agents and artificial intelligence to "cut through" unlimited information and obtain personalized solutions. Taking this assumption into account, this paper presents Sem-Fit, a semantic hotel recommendation expert system, based on the consumer's experience about recommendation provided by the system. Sem-Fit uses the consumer's experience point of view in order to apply fuzzy logic techniques to relating customer and hotel characteristics, represented by means of domain ontologies and affect grids. After receiving a recommendation, the customer provides a valuation about the recommendation generated by the system. Based on these valuations, the rules of the system are updated in order to adjust the new recommendations to past user experiences. To test the validity of Sem-Fit, the validation accomplished includes the interaction of the customer with the system and then the results are compared with the expert recommendation for each customer profile. Moreover, the values of precision and recall and F1 have been calculated, based on three points of view, to measure the degree of relevance of the recommendations of the fuzzy system, showing that the system recommendations are on the same level as an expert in the domain. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The increase in the number of documents has aggravated the difficulty of classifying those documents according to specific needs. Clustering analysis in a distributed environment is a thrust area in artificial intelligence and data mining. Its fundamental task is to utilize characters to compute the degree of related corresponding relationship between objects and to accomplish automatic classification without earlier knowledge. Document clustering utilizes clustering technique to gather the documents of high resemblance collectively by computing the documents resemblance. Recent studies have shown that ontologies are useful in improving the performance of document clustering. Ontology is concerned with the conceptualization of a domain into an individual identifiable format and machine-readable format containing entities, attributes, relationships, and axioms. By analyzing types of techniques for document clustering, a better clustering technique depending on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is determined. Non-Dominated Ranked Genetic Algorithm (NRGA) is used in this paper for clustering, which has the capability of providing a better classification result. The experiment is conducted in 20 newsgroups data set for evaluating the proposed technique. The result shows that the proposed approach is very effective in clustering the documents in the distributed environment. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012, IGI Global.},

In this paper, we present a novel ontology construction based on combination of C-value method, artificial neural networks, Bayesian network and fuzzy theory. First, domain-related documents were collected. Secondly, the C-value method was implemented for extracting meaningful terms from documents. Then, an ART neural network was used to cluster documents, and terms' weight was calculated by TF-IDF method in order to find candidate keyword for each cluster. Next, the Bayesian network and lexicosyntactic patterns were applied to construct the initial ontology. Finally, the expert's views exerted to the initial ontology for enrichment, and the final fuzzy ontology is constructed. The primary results show that the proposed ontology learning method has higher precision than similar studies.},

Implementations of different conceptual knowledge in the information retrieval process such as ontology have been considered as a solution to enhance the quality of results. Furthermore, the conceptual formalism supported by typical ontology may not be sufficient to represent uncertainty information due to the lack of clear-cut boundaries between concepts of the domains. To tackle this type of problems, one possible solution is to insert fuzzy logic into ontology construction process. In this article, a novel approach for fuzzy ontology generation with two uncertainty degrees is proposed. Hence, by implementing linguistic variables, uncertainty level in domain's concepts (Software Maintenance Engineering (SME) domain) has been modeled, and ontology relations have been modeled by fuzzy theory consequently. Then, we combined these uncertain models and proposed a new ontology with two degrees of uncertainty both in concept expression and relation expression. The generated fuzzy ontology was implemented for expansion of initial user's queries in SME domain. Experimental results showed that the proposed model has better overall retrieval performance comparing to keyword-based or crisp ontology-based retrieval systems.

significant interest from both the researcher's and the practitioner's
communities in modularization techniques as a way to decrease the
complexity of managing huge ontologies. On the other hand, it has been
widely pointed out that classical ontologies are not appropriate to deal
with imprecise and vague knowledge, which is inherent to several real
world domains. In order to handle these types of knowledge, some fuzzy
extensions of classical ontologies are presented, yielding fuzzy
ontologies. In this paper, we integrate modular ontologies with fuzzy
ontologies, i.e., the notion of modular fuzzy ontologies is presented.
Furthermore, we present an infrastructure for the representation of and

abstract = {This paper presents a Web-based system for supporting the selection of
the most suitable routes for buried urban utilities. The aim of the
proposed system is to support (not make) decisions through a
collaborative semiautomated environment, in which stakeholders can share
information and/or study the impacts of different routing alternatives
with respect to decision constraints. First, the knowledge relating to
route selection for urban utilities is represented through an ontology.
The ontology defines the types and attributes of infrastructure products
and the surrounding areas. It also defines the impacts of routing
options on surrounding areas through a set of decision criteria adopted
to evaluate the effectiveness of any route in terms of its potential
impacts. A set of constraints are also defined to help represent/study
the decision criteria. Second, a GIS-based system has been created to
help visualize route data, interact with users, and support the needed
discussions among stakeholders. The portal also achieves data
interoperability through wrapping existing geospatial data with ontology
structures. Finally, a set of reasoners have been created to help
quantify/augment some of the constraints. The system is capable of (1)
extracting the attributes of each routing option, (2) testing the
interaction/conflicts between route attributes and the constraints of
the surrounding area, (3) studying the impacts of a route as stipulated
in the ontology, (4) referring users to existing best practices to help
enhance routes or address conflicts and, when needed, (5) develop
objective measures for comparing different routes. On the microlevel
(street level), route options are evaluated through a
``constraint-satisfaction{\{}''{\}} approach. On the macrolevel (city level),
route options are evaluated through a fuzzy inference scoring system.
The proposed system focuses on facility life cycle, sustainability, and
community impacts. Construction costing, scheduling, labor, and
equipment along with other management issues can either be added to the
system or, better, analyzed through integrating the system with
four-dimensional (4D) modeling tools. DOI:

Furthermore, we present a novel approach to semantic decision making by

the information specificity or generality of documents. Basically, a
document is considered more specific than another document if it
contains more cohesive domain-specific terminologies than that of the
other one. We believe that the dimension of semantic granularity is an
important supplement to the existing similarity-based and
popularity-based measures for building effective document ranking
functions. The main contributions of this paper is the illustration of
the design and development of a fuzzy ontology based granular
information retrieval (IR) system to improve the effectiveness of IR
decision making for various domains. Based on the notion of semantic
information granulation, a novel computational model is developed to
estimate the semantic granularity of documents; these documents can then
be ranked according to the information seekers' specific semantic
granularity requirements. One main component of the proposed
computational model is the fuzzy ontology mining mechanism which can
automatically build domain-specific ontology for the estimation of
semantic granularity of documents. Our TREC-based experiment reveals
that the proposed fuzzy ontology based granular IR system outperforms a
classical vector space based IR system in domain specific IR. Our

abstract = {Natural language question-and-answering is one of the most convenient
means for communicating with the Semantic Web, which is typically in the
form of online knowledge bases encoded in Web Ontology Language (OWL).
To understand a natural language question, it is essential that it can
be translated into a query that is understandable by the knowledge
bases. This article is concerned with the task of semantic mapping from
natural language questions to OWL queries, and proposes an automatic and
domain-independent mapping framework, called Three-Phases Semantic
Mapping (TPSM). The TPSM framework approaches the task of semantic
mapping in three interrelated phases: (i) formalizing knowledge, (ii)
building semantic mapping, and (iii) combining OWL queries. First,
formalizing knowledge formalizes the units of mapping in the natural
language and OWL knowledge. Second, semantic mapping builds the
transverse mapping between questions and OWL knowledge, as formalized in
the first phase, by means of working with the so-called Fuzzy Constraint
Satisfaction Problems (FCSP). Third, combining OWL queries obtains valid
Resource Description Framework (RDF) models by applying predefined
templates and their corresponding combining methods. We have implemented
a prototype semantic mapping system based on the framework, and have
conducted a series of experimental validations involving OWL knowledge
bases in different domains as queried by various types of questions.},

The DSS encodes high-level, specialized medical knowledge in terms of ontologies and fuzzy rules and applies this knowledge in conjunction with a fuzzy inference engine to classify WMLs and to obtain a measure of their volumes. The performance of the DSS has been quantitatively evaluated on 120 patients affected by MS. Specifically, binary classification results have been first obtained by applying thresholds on fuzzy outputs and then evaluated, by means of ROC curves, in terms of trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Similarity measures of WMLs have been also computed for a further quantitative analysis. Moreover, a statistical analysis has been carried out for appraising the DSS influence on the diagnostic tasks of physicians. The evaluation has shown that the DSS offers an innovative and valuable way to perform automated WML classification in real clinical settings.},

abstract = {Taking into account that fuzzy ontology mapping has wide application and cannot be dealt with in many fields at present, a Chinese fuzzy ontology model and a method for Chinese fuzzy ontology mapping are proposed. The mapping discovery between two ontologies is achieved by computing the similarity between the concepts of two ontologies. Every concept consists of four features of concept name, property, instance and structure. First, the algorithms of calculating four individual similarities corresponding to the four features are given. Secondly, the similarity vectors consisting of four weighted individual similarities are built, and the weights are the linear function of harmony and reliability. The similarity vector is used to represent the similarity relation between two concepts which belong to different fuzzy ontolgoies. Lastly, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to get the mapping concept pairs by the similarity vectors. Experiment results are satisfactory.},

The historical fault data of steam turbine is processed with ANFIS, the ANFIS is trained via teacher's guidance, and the ANFIS is optimized by genetic algorithm. Based on the ontology of ANFIS, the data mining algorithm for classified fault diagnosis and rectification rules about bearing vibration of steam turbine is brought forward; in the given steps, computing the measurement matrix of effect; extracting rules; Computing the importance of rules; Shearing the rules by genetic algorithm. An experimental system for data mining, fault diagnosis and fault rectification bearing vibration of steam turbine based on ANFIS and genetic algorithm is implemented and its diagnosis precision is 86 {\%}. And Experiments do prove that it is a feasible to use the method to develop a system for fault diagnosis and fault remedy of bearing vibration of steam turbine, which is valuable for further study in more depth. Bearing fault diagnostics and a remedy method is presented in this paper using ANFIS and GA based on vibration data. Both time-domain and frequency-domain features are used as input data for bearing fault detection. Two separate ANFIS, one for fault diagnosis and treatment of faults, are used and called Diagnostic-ANFIS or D-ANFIS and Treatment-ANFIS or T-ANFIS respectively. Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been proposed to select the ANFIS model input and output parameters. Training results give the optimized ANFIS for bearing fault diagnosis and its rectification based on measured vibration data. The result is also tested with other set of bearing data to illustrate the reliability of the chosen model.},

The proposed mechanism of domain ontology construction includes four steps. First, domain documents preprocessing aims to separates the text into sentences, including a Chinese Partof-Speech (POS) Tag and a Chinese corpus extract from the HowNet. Next, the concept clustering based on the fuzzy cmeans aims to cluster concepts and instances from documents. In third step, context extraction aims to obtain the contexts. Finally, domain ontology construction aims to generate a petroleum exploration Chinese domain ontology. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively construct Chinese domain ontology from unstructured text documents.

fuzzy clustering to extract useful data. It is possible to distinguish

in the product space of systems inputs and outputs and each cluster
corresponds to a fuzzy IF-THEN rule. By initializing the clustering with
a number of clusters and subsequently removing less important ones as
the clustering progresses, it is sought to obtain a suitable partition
of the data in an automated manner. The approach is generally applicable
to the fuzzy-means and related algorithms. In this paper, this method

years have witnessed many efforts on discovering fuzzy associations. The
key strength of fuzzy association rule mining is its completeness. This
strength, however, comes with a major drawback to handle large datasets.
It often produces a huge number of candidate itemsets. The huge number
of candidate itemsets makes it ineffective for a data mining system to
analyze them. In the end, it produces a huge number of fuzzy
associations. This is particularly true for datasets whose attributes
are highly correlated. The huge number of fuzzy associations makes it
very difficult for a human user to analyze them. Existing research has
shown that most of the discovered rules are actually redundant or
insignificant. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to overcome
these problems; we are preprocessing the data tuples by focusing on
similar behaviour attributes and ontology. Finally, the efficiency and
advantages of this algorithm have been proved by experimental results.},

Evaluating the validity of such unsupervised gene classification remains a challenge given the variety of distance measures and classification algorithms that can be used. We evaluate here functional classification of genes with the help of reference sets: KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways and Pfam clans. These sets represent ground truth for any distance based on GO (Gene Ontology) biological process and molecular function annotations respectively. Overlaps between clusters and reference sets are estimated by the F-score method. We test our previously described IntelliGO semantic distance with hierarchical and fuzzy C-means clustering and we compare results with the state-of-the-art DAVID (Database for Annotation Visualisation and Integrated Discovery) functional classification method. Finally, study of best matching clusters to reference sets leads us to propose a set-difference method for discovering missing information.

The methods and algorithms aim to support the dialogue with the repositories of text and multimedia resources gathered on some servers. To realize the objectives of the stages B13 and B14 of the SYNAT project we plan to develop and implement a system called SONCA (Search based on ONtologies and Compound Analytics). We present ideas and proposals for the SONCA system. The main idea is to allow combination of metadata-based search, syntactic keyword-based search and semantic search, and to use ranks of objects. Semantic search criteria may be keywords, concepts, or objects (for checking similarity). Search criteria based on metadata play the role of exact restrictions, while syntactic keywords and semantic search criteria are fuzzy restrictions. To enable metadata-based search, an appropriate document representation is used. To enable syntactic keyword-based search, each document (object) is stored together with information about the terms occurring in its text attributes. The terms are normalized and only important ones are stored. To enable semantic search, the representation of each document (object) is extended further with the most important concepts that characterize the document. Such concepts belong to the main ontology of SONCA. We provide an abstract model for the SONCA system, an instantiation of that model, some ideas for the user interface of SONCA as well as proposals for increasing efficiency of the query answering process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Personalization is increasingly vital especially for enterprises to be
able to reach their customers. The key challenge in supporting
personalization is the need for rich metadata, such as metadata about
structural relationships, subject/concept relations between documents
and cognitive metadata about documents (e. g. difficulty of a document).
Manual annotation of large knowledge bases with such rich metadata is
not scalable. As well as, automatic mining of cognitive metadata is
challenging since it is very difficult to understand underlying
intellectual knowledge about document automatically. On the other hand,
the Web content is increasing becoming multilingual since growing amount
of data generated on the Web is non-English. Current metadata extraction
systems are generally based on English content and this requires to be
revolutionized in order to adapt to the changing dynamics of the Web. To
alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel automatic metadata
extraction framework, which is based on a novel fuzzy based method for
automatic cognitive metadata generation and uses different document
parsing algorithms to extract rich metadata from multilingual enterprise
content using the newly developed DocBook, Resource Type and Topic
ontologies. Since the metadata generation process is based upon DocBook
structured enterprise content, our framework is focused on enterprise
documents and content which is loosely based on the DocBook type of
formatting. DocBook is a common documentation formatting to formally
produce corporate data and it is adopted by many enterprises. The
proposed framework is illustrated and evaluated on English, German and
French versions of the Symantec Norton 360 knowledge bases. The user
study showed that the proposed fuzzy-based method generates reasonably
accurate values with an average precision of 89.39{\%} on the metadata
values of document difficulty, document interactivity level and document
interactivity type. The proposed fuzzy inference system achieves
improved results compared to a rule-based reasoner for difficulty
metadata extraction (similar to 11{\%} enhancement). In addition, user
perceived metadata quality scores (mean of 5.57 out of 6) found to be
high and automated metadata analysis showed that the extracted metadata
is high quality and can be suitable for personalized information
retrieval. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Over the last decade there has been an increasing interest in
semi-supervised clustering. Several studies have suggested that even a
small amount of supervised information can significantly improve the
results of unsupervised learning. One popular method of incorporating
partial supervised information is through pair-wise constraints
indicating whether a certain pair of patterns should belong to the same
(Must-link) or different (Dont-link) clusters. In this study we propose
a novel semi-supervised fuzzy clustering algorithm (SSFCA). The
supervised information is incorporated via a method quantifying
Must-link and/or Dont-link constraints. Additionally, we present an
extension of SSFCA that allows the algorithm to automatically detect the
number of clusters in the data. We apply SSFCA to the intrinsic problem
of gene expression profiles clustering. The advantageous properties of
fuzzy logic, inherited to SSFCA, allow genes to belong to more than one
group, revealing this way more profound information concerning their
multiple functioning roles. Finally, we investigate the incorporation of
prior biological knowledge arriving from Gene Ontology in the process of
selecting pair-wise constraints. Simulations on artificial and real life
datasets proved that the proposed SSFCA significantly outperformed other
standard and semi-supervised clustering methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Heart Rate Variability (HRV) represents a physiological phenomenon which
consists in the oscillation in the interval between consecutive
heartbeats. Based on the HRV analysis, cardiology experts can make a
assessment for both the cardiac health and the condition of the
autonomic nervous system that is responsible for controlling heart
activity and, consequently, they try to prevent cardiovascular
mortality. In this scenario, one of the most widely accepted and
low-cost diagnostic procedures useful for deriving and evaluating the
HRV is surely the electrocardiogram (ECG), i.e., a transthoracic
interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over a period of
time. With the advent of modern signal processing techniques, the
diagnostic power of the ECG is increased exponentially due to the huge
number of features that are typically extracted from the ECG signal.
Even though this expanded set of features could allow medical staffs to
diagnose various pathologies in an accurate way, it is too complex to
manage in a manual way and, for this reason, methods for feature
representation and evaluation are necessary for supporting medical
diagnosis. Starting from this consideration, this paper proposes an
enhanced ECG-based decision making system exploiting a collection of
ontological models representing the ECG and HRV feature sets and a fuzzy
inference engine based on Type-2 Fuzzy Markup Language capable of
evaluating the ECG and HRV properties related to a given person and
infer detailed information about his health quality level. As will be
shown in the experimental section, where the proposed approach has been
tested on a set of under exams students, our diagnostic framework yields
good performances both in terms of precision and recall.},

Context aware computing attains environments monitoring by means of sensors to provide relevant information or services according to the identified context. In particular, wireless ad hoc sensor networks for medical purposes are playing an increasing role within healthcare. Body Sensor Networks (BSN) are being designed for prophylactic and follow-up monitoring of patients in e.g. their homes, during hospitalization, and in emergencies. This work presents an integrated environment aimed at providing personalized healthcare services which appropriately meet the userʼs context.

Nevertheless, in a context aware domain purely logic-based reasoning on respectively context and services may not be enough. The main idea of this work is related to enrich with qualitative representation of context underling data by means of Fuzzy Logic in order to automatically recognize the context and to consequently find the right set of healthcare services among the available ones. Semantic formalisms (e.g., OWL, OWL-S, etc.) enable the context and services modeling in terms of domain ontology concepts. On the other hand, soft computing techniques support activity of unsupervised context analysis and healthcare semantic service discovery. Goal is to define context-aware system whose quality of retrieved services relies on the acquisition of user context by means of a robust theoretical approach. Moreover, this work defines hybrid architecture which attains a synergy between the agent-based paradigm and the fuzzy modeling.

The experimental results show that type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS) performs better than type-1 FLS, proving that type-2 FLS can provide a powerful paradigm to handle the high level of uncertainties present in diet. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In addition, malware have become a growing important problem for governments and commercial organizations. The key point of the research on the network security is to judge and validate the similarity metrics among the malicious software. Indeed, most computer network issues are also caused by malware. As a consequence, one enhanced system to analyze the behavior of malwares is needed to try to predict the malicious actions and to minimize the computer damages caused by the malware. However, the conventional data analysis tools lack the ability to deal with the computer safety because the environments malwares operating are with high levels of imprecision and vagueness. For this reason, we have developed Taiwan Malware Analysis Net (TWMAN) to improve the accuracy of malware behavioral analysis.

Recent studies have shown that, in order to improve the performance of document clustering, ontologies are useful. Ontology is nothing but the conceptualization of a domain into an individual identifiable format, but machine-readable format containing entities, attributes, relationships and axioms. By analyzing all types of techniques for document clustering, a clustering technique depending on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is determined to be better as GA is a global convergence technique and has the ability of determining the most suitable cluster centers without difficulties.

abstract = {This chapter presents an FML-based semantic inference mechanism for an After School Alternative Program (ASAP) in Taiwan. The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)-based assessment system for Taiwan's ASAP is constructed by National University of Tainan (NUTN) from 2007 to 2011. The basic process of the assessment systems is as follows. First, domain experts provide item descriptions to construct the item fuzzy ontology repository. Second, a T-score scale item map is constructed for each item bank by applying the calibration procedures for the 3-parameter Item Response Theory (IRT) model. Third, student responses stored in the response data repository are processed, analyzed, and then summarized to obtain the semantic descriptions of student performance level. The item-map representation then summarizes the performance of each student. Next, the results are stored in the diagnosis report repository so that users such as the involved students, teachers, officers, or the ASAP administrator can retrieve the reports through the provided ASAP web platform. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is feasible for large-scale implementation of automatically generated diagnostic reports for the CMMI-based ASAP assessment system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Proactive education paradigm pursues to infer future possible events and states of the teaching-learning cycle to accomplish better students' apprenticeship, and overcome likely issues. An essential functionality to implement such a paradigm is the prediction. Thus, our approach aims at anticipating student's domain knowledge (DK) acquisition through the development, and use of a causal and fuzzy student model (CFSM). The CFSM depicts several domains of student's attributes, that are taken into account for sequencing lectures to students. Moreover, it also characterizes attributes of the content, to shape the nature of the available lectures authored to teach a given concept. Both sorts of attributes are defined semantically as concepts in an ontology. These concepts set causal relationships between each other. This type of relationships represents a belief of how an attribute exerts the status and activation of another attribute. Concepts and causal relationships are sketched as a cognitive map (CM). The description of the attributes and the causal relationships are respectively made by fuzzy values and fuzzy rules-bases. Linguistic terms instantiate the state of concepts and a version of fuzzy-causal inference is fulfilled to produce causal behavior and outcomes about the state of the concepts. Based on these elements, our approach simulates the learning results that a lecture could produce on student's apprenticeship. Such a prediction is accounted to choose the most profitable lecture for being delivered to student. As a result of an experiment, we found out those users of a web-based educational system (WBES) that sequences lectures based on the advice given by the CFSM reached 17{\%} higher learning than their peers who did not have the support of our approach. So in this work, we highlight the attributes of the approach. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract = {Currently, many research studies have been concentrated on construction
of fuzzy ontologies from different sources. Over the years, standard and
variations of the entity-relationship (ER) model has widespread use, and
also some approaches have been proposed for modeling fuzzy information
in ER and extended entity-relationship (EER) models.
Therefore,constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy EER models may be
valuable to the development of fuzzy ontologies, and in turn the
constructed fuzzy ontologies may be useful for reasoning about the fuzzy
EER models. In this paper, we develop a semantics-preserving approach
and an automated tool for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy EER
models, and investigate how to apply the constructed fuzzy ontologies to
reason on fuzzy EER models. The constructed fuzzy ontologies are
represented by the fuzzy OWL language, which is a fuzzy extension of the
W3C recommendation standard ontology language OWL (Web Ontology
Language). Firstly, we give the formalization of fuzzy EER models. On
this basis, we propose an approach for constructing fuzzy OWL ontologies
from fuzzy EER models, which can transform fuzzy EER models (including
the structure and instance information of fuzzy EER models) into fuzzy
OWL ontologies. Also, we give the proof for the semantics preservation
of the transformation, and provide a detailed transformation example.
Furthermore, we implement a prototype tool FEER2FOnto, which can
automatically construct fuzzy OWL ontologies from fuzzy EER models.
Finally, we investigate how to reason on fuzzy EER models with the
constructed fuzzy OWL ontologies, and propose the reasoning approach and
provide a reasoning example. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sensor networks are a concept that has become very popular in data
acquisition and processing for multiple applications in different fields
such as industrial, medicine, home automation, environmental detection,
etc. Today, with the proliferation of small communication devices with
sensors that collect environmental data, semantic Web technologies are
becoming closely related with sensor networks. The linking of elements
from Semantic Web technologies with sensor networks has been called
Semantic Sensor Web and has among its main features the use of
ontologies. One of the key challenges of using ontologies in sensor
networks is to provide mechanisms to integrate and exchange knowledge
from heterogeneous sources (that is, dealing with semantic
heterogeneity). Ontology alignment is the process of bringing ontologies
into mutual agreement by the automatic discovery of mappings between
related concepts. This paper presents a system for ontology alignment in
the Semantic Sensor Web which uses fuzzy logic techniques to combine
similarity measures between entities of different ontologies. The
proposed approach focuses on two key elements: the terminological
similarity, which takes into account the linguistic and semantic
information of the context of the entity's names, and the structural
similarity, based on both the internal and relational structure of the
concepts. This work has been validated using sensor network ontologies
and the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tests. The
results show that the proposed techniques outperform previous approaches
in terms of precision and recall.},

abstract = {The main contribution of this work consists of combining a heuristic
method for propagation of matchable concepts and using consensus
techniques for conflict resolution for fuzzy ontology integration. Two
central observations behind this approach are as follows: (1) if two
concepts across different source ontologies equivalently match each
other, then their neighboring concepts will be often matched as well;
and (2) conflicts regarding integration of multiple ontologies can be
resolved by creating a consensus among the conflict ontological
entities. The key idea of the first observation is to start from an
aligned pair of concepts (called medoids) to determine so-called
potentially common parts to provide additional suggestions for possible
matching concepts. This approach is used to obtain pairs of matchable
concepts and to avoid pairs of mismatching concepts. On the other hand,
the second observation is used to discover a new merged concept from
matched concepts by making a consensus among conflict ontological
entities. This idea is to determine the best representative as the
merged version of the component ones. A combination of both observations
for fuzzy ontology integration is a significant contribution of this
work. The results of the experiments imply that the proposed approach is
effective with regard to both completeness and accuracy.},

abstract = {To remain competitive in business and to be quick responsive in the
warehouse and supply chain, the use of RFID has been increasing in many
industry areas. RFID can identify multiple objects simultaneously as
well as identifying individual objects respectively. Some limitations of
RFID still remain in the low recognition rate and the sensitive response
according to the material type and its ambient environment. Much effort
has been made to enhance the recognition rate and to be more robust.
Examples include tag design change, antenna angle, search angle, and
signal intensity to name a few.
The paper proposes fuzzy logic based ontological knowledge system for
improving the recognition rate of RFID and the variance of recognition.
In order to improve a performance and reduce a variance, the following
sub-goals are pursued. First, ontology is constructed for the
environmental factors to be used as a knowledge base. Second, fuzzy
membership function is defined using the Forward Link Budget in RFID.
Finally, a conceptual knowledge system is proposed and tested to verify
the model in the experimental environment.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 provides user-friendly tools that allow persons to create and
publish content online. User generated content often takes the form of
short texts (e.g., blog posts, news feeds, snippets, etc). This has
motivated an increasing interest on the analysis of short texts and,
specifically, on their categorisation. Text categorisation is the task
of classifying documents into a certain number of predefined categories.
Traditional text classification techniques are mainly based on word
frequency statistical analysis and have been proved inadequate for the
classification of short texts where word occurrence is too small. On the
other hand, the classic approach to text categorization is based on a
learning process that requires a large number of labeled training texts
to achieve an accurate performance. However labeled documents might not
be available, when unlabeled documents can be easily collected. This
paper presents an approach to text categorisation which does not need a
pre-classified set of training documents. The proposed method only
requires the category names as user input. Each one of these categories
is defined by means of an ontology of terms modelled by a set of what we
call proximity equations. Hence, our method is not category occurrence
frequency based, but highly depends on the definition of that category
and how the text fits that definition. Therefore, the proposed approach
is an appropriate method for short text classification where the
frequency of occurrence of a category is very small or even zero.
Another feature of our method is that the classification process is
based on the ability of an extension of the standard Prolog language,
named Bousi similar to Prolog , for flexible matching and knowledge
representation. This declarative approach provides a text classifier
which is quick and easy to build, and a classification process which is
easy for the user to understand. The results of experiments showed that
the proposed method achieved a reasonably useful performance.},

abstract = {The success and proliferation of the Semantic Web depends heavily on construction of Web ontologies. However, classical ontology construction approaches are not sufficient for handling imprecise and uncertain information that is commonly found in many application domains. Therefore, great efforts on construction of fuzzy ontologies have been made in recent years. In particular, XML is imposing itself as a standard for representing and exchanging information on the Web, topics related to the modeling of fuzzy data have become very interesting in the XML data context. Therefore, constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy XML data resources may make the existing fuzzy XML data upgrade to Semantic Web contents, and the constructed fuzzy ontologies may be useful for improving some fuzzy XML applications. This paper proposes a formal approach and an automated tool for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy XML data resources. Firstly, we propose a formal definition of fuzzy XML models (including the document structure fuzzy DTDs and the document content fuzzy XML documents). On this basis, we propose a formal approach for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy XML models, i.e., transforming a fuzzy XML model (including fuzzy DTD and fuzzy XML document) into a fuzzy ontology. Also, we give the proof of correctness of the construction approach, and provide a detailed construction example. Furthermore, we implement a prototype tool called FXML2FOnto, which can automatically construct fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy XML models. Finally, in order to show that the constructed fuzzy ontologies may be useful for improving some fuzzy XML applications, we focus on investigating how to reason on fuzzy XML models (e.g., conformance, inclusion, and equivalence) based on the constructed fuzzy ontologies, and it turns out that the reasoning tasks of fuzzy XML models can be checked by means of the reasoning mechanism of fuzzy ontologies.},

allows us to model and reason about vague, incomplete, and uncertain
knowledge. Some relevant subdomains found to be missing in previous
proposed ontologies for this domain were modelled as well. The resulting
fuzzy OWL 2 ontology is able to model uncertain knowledge and represent
temporal relationships between activities using an underlying fuzzy
state machine representation. We provide a proof of concept of the
approach in work scenarios such as the office domain, and also make
experiments to emphasize the benefits of our approach with respect to
crisp ontologies. As a result, we demonstrate that the inclusion of
fuzzy concepts and relations in the ontology provide benefits during the

abstract = {Knowledge representation and reasoning plays an essential role in creating machine-processing content in the context of the Semantic Web. Ontology, which can capture the knowledge in a domain in a formal and machine-processable way, is a W3C standard knowledge representation model for the Semantic Web. Also, as an important representation of knowledge, rules, which possess many features including high expressiveness, terseness and requiring small memory space, can enhance the expressive power of the Semantic Web ontologies. In particular, ontology has the reasoning nature because of the existence of Description Logics, which are a family of logic-based knowledge representation formalisms designed to represent and reason about the knowledge of an application domain in a structured and well-understood way. Therefore, all of these features let ontologies, Description Logics, and rules become indispensable and widely used in the context of the Semantic Web. In this chapter, we briefly introduce some basic notions of Description Logics, ontologies, and rules. However, the traditional ontologies, Description Logics, and rules feature limitations, mainly with what can be said about fuzzy information that is commonly found in many application domains. In order to provide the necessary means to handle such information and knowledge there are today a huge number of proposals for fuzzy extensions to ontologies, Description Logics, and rules. In particular, Zadeh's fuzzy set theory (Zadeh 1965) has been identified as a successful technique for modelling the fuzzy information in many application areas, especially in the Semantic Web. In the next chapter, we will briefly introduce the fuzzy set theory. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2014.},

The existing numerous contributions of fuzzy data models provide the rich data resource support for the fuzzy knowledge management in the Semantic Web. Besides of the extraction techniques of fuzzy knowledge, for realizing the fuzzy knowledge management in the Semantic We, the other issues about mapping, query and storage of fuzzy DLs/ontologies also have been attracting significant attention as will be introduced in the later chapters. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2014.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition is a key task in ambient intelligence applications to achieve proper ambient assisted living. There has been remarkable progress in this domain, but some challenges still remain to obtain robust methods. Our goal in this work is to provide a system that allows the modeling and recognition of a set of complex activities in real life scenarios involving interaction with the environment. The proposed framework is a hybrid model that comprises two main modules: a low level sub-activity recognizer, based on data-driven methods, and a high-level activity recognizer, implemented with a fuzzy ontology to include the semantic interpretation of actions performed by users. The fuzzy ontology is fed by the sub-activities recognized by the low level data-driven component and provides fuzzy ontological reasoning to recognize both the activities and their influence in the environment with semantics. An additional benefit of the approach is the ability to handle vagueness and uncertainty in the knowledge-based module, which substantially outperforms the treatment of incomplete and/or imprecise data with respect to classic crisp ontologies. We validate these advantages with the public CAD-120 dataset (Cornell Activity Dataset), achieving an accuracy of 90.1{\%} and 91.07{\%} for low-level and high-level activities, respectively. This entails an improvement over fully data-driven or ontology-based approaches. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In light of the shortcomings of existing scheduling command decision support systems, this paper constructs a Metro Emergency Scheduling ontology knowledge base, defines the core concept and structure of metro emergency, and sets up the concept data attributes and constraint relations. On this basis, we introduce the idea of fuzzy reasoning in the assessment of the level of threat to metro security's physical components, generate the fuzzy rule base according to the fuzzy rules, and use the Sigmoid fuzzy membership function to fuzzy up the underlying input indicators. Then we construct the fuzzy reasoning based on fuzzy rules, in order to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the physical components of the existing metro operator safety factors, and realize the reasoning for emergency scheduling decisions that can help the scheduling personnel to make decisions in a timely manner in the event of a disaster as well as dispatch relief resources optimally.},

abstract = {In order to represent the widespread imprecision and uncertainty in Semantic Web applications, there have been substantial amounts of work carried out in the context of fuzzy extensions of (Description Logics) DLs and ontologies, and corresponding reasoning algorithms and reasoners are thus developed. Also, some querying techniques are developed to provide users with querying services. However, some existing simple queries, such as instance retrieval, are relatively weak in expressive power and are unable to effectively express users' query intents. Therefore, with emergence of these large-scale fuzzy DL knowledge bases (KBs) and fuzzy ontologies, it is of particular importance to provide users with expressive querying services. In particular, conjunctive queries (CQs) originated from research in relational databases, and, more recently, have also been identified as a desirable form of querying DL knowledge bases. Conjunctive queries provide an expressive query language with capabilities that go beyond standard instance retrieval. In this chapter, we will focus on the querying techniques of fuzzy DL KBs and fuzzy ontologies. We aim at introducing the conjunctive querying techniques from tractable to more expressive fuzzy DL KBs. Also, querying over fuzzy ontologies and some flexible extensions to the W3C standard query language SPARQL will be included. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2014.},

abstract = {Based on the introduction in this chapter, it is shown that lots of fuzzy Description Logics (DLs) and fuzzy ontologies have been investigated in order to handle fuzzy information in real-world applications. In particular, fuzzy DLs and fuzzy ontologies are the acknowledged key of representing and reasoning with knowledge in the Semantic Web. In this chapter, we focus our attention on the recent research achievements on fuzzy extension approaches of DLs and ontologies based on fuzzy set theory, and we provide a brief review of them. We introduce several fuzzy DLs in detail, including the tractable fuzzy DL f-DLR-Lite F,∩ proposed in Cheng et al. (2008); the expressive fuzzy DLs f-ALC (Straccia 1998) and FDLR (Zhang et al. 2008c; Ma et al. 2011); and the fuzzy DLs with fuzzy data types f-SHOIN(D) (Straccia 2005b) and F-ALC(G) (Wang and Ma 2008). A fuzzy DL reasoner called FRESG supporting fuzzy data information with customized fuzzy data types G (Wang et al. 2009) is introduced. Also, a definition of fuzzy ontologies is given in order to provide a general understanding of fuzzy ontologies. All of these are of interest or relevance to the discussions of successive chapters. After reviewing most of the proposals of fuzzy extensions, it has been widely approved that fuzzy DLs and fuzzy ontologies could play a key role in the Semantic Web by serving as a mathematical framework for fuzzy knowledge representation and reasoning in applications. However, the researches on fuzzy DLs/ontologies are still in a developing stage and still the full potential of fuzzy DLs/ontologies has not been exhaustively explored. Some very important issues on fuzzy DLs/ontologies may be important in order for fuzzy DL/ontology technologies to be more widely adoptable in the Semantic Web and other application domains, such as extraction, mapping, query, and storage, which have increasingly received attention as will be discussed in detail in the later chapters. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2014.},

Cloud service composition, which includes several tasks such as discovery, compatibility checking, selection, and deployment, is a complex process and users find it difficult to select the best one among the hundreds, if not thousands, of possible compositions available. Service composition in Cloud raises even new challenges caused by diversity of users with different expertise requiring their applications to be deployed across difference geographical locations with distinct legal constraints. The main difficulty lies in selecting a combination of virtual appliances (software images) and infrastructure services that are compatible and satisfy a user with vague preferences. Therefore, we present a framework and algorithms which simplify Cloud service composition for unskilled users. We develop an ontology-based approach to analyze Cloud service compatibility by applying reasoning on the expert knowledge. In addition, to minimize effort of users in expressing their preferences, we apply combination of evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy logic for composition optimization. This lets users express their needs in linguistics terms which brings a great comfort to them compared to systems that force users to assign exact weights for all preferences. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

This represents another challenge for the scientists to create a report grouping calculation with the point of view of bringing more exact results. Accordingly, a document similarity measure, called SMTP is developed and it is applied to k-means. SMTP measure misses the semantic incorporation completely while finding the similarity between archives sets. Semantics has been introduced at various linguistic levels i.e., word level, sentence level and document content extraction level and at various stages of Information Retrieval such as query and document representation, and in indexing. In data clustering, to discover the similitude in the middle of archives alongside recurrence of the words displayed in the report, the semantic words is distinguished from the ontology and they are additionally used to discover the similarity score furthermore, clustering methodology is focused around the possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering. The execution of the proposed calculation is assessed with webkb and news20 dataset. Utilizing the performance measurements, clustering accuracy and entropy, the performance is ascertained. The performance is good for semantic similarity measure and possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering calculation. The accuracy is better contrasted with the other similarity measure. {\textcopyright} Research India Publications.},

Although many earlier methods tried to create a fuzzy ontology and applied it to documents summarization, none of the previous methods have discussed Arabic document summarization using FA fuzzy ontology which could benefit future research. This paper presents a new technique for Arabic document summarization using a fuzzy ontology, which is a fuzzy linguistic variable ontology and Field Association (FA) words. It is more suitable to describe fuzzy linguistic variable ontology than domain ontology for solving the uncertainty reasoning problem. At first, the domain ontology with various events Arabic language is predefined. The document preprocessing mechanism generates the meaningful terms based on Arabic corpus and Arabic language dictionary defined by the domain expert. Then, the meaningful terms have been classified according to an FA term classifier algorithm. Every fuzzy concept has a set of membership degrees associated with various events of the domain ontology. In addition, some process based on the fuzzy ontology is also developed for Arabic document summarization. From the experimental results, it is clear that the average of summarization accuracy achieved 69{\%}, 68{\%} and 68{\%} in terms of Recall, Precision and F-measure. The results show that the Arabic doc- ument based on FA words and fuzzy ontology can effectively operate for summarization.

abstract = {Fuzzy extensions to description logics (DLs) have gained considerable attention the last decade. So far most works on fuzzy DLs have focused on either very expressive languages, like fuzzy OWL and OWL 2, or on highly inexpressive ones, like fuzzy OWL 2 QL and fuzzy OWL 2 EL. To the best of our knowledge, a fuzzy extension to the language OWL 2 RL has not been thoroughly studied so far. This language is very relevant since it combines both adequate expressive power as well as efficient reasoning algorithms which can be realized using rule-based (Datalog) technologies. In contrast to previous fuzzy extensions, a fuzzy extension of OWL 2 RL is not a straightforward task for the following reason. The main motivation of OWL 2 RL is that its axioms can be equivalently represented as Datalog rules. Hence, to achieve our goal we need to investigate which OWL 2 RL axioms when interpreted under the fuzzy setting can be transformed to equivalent fuzzy Datalog rules. We show that this is not, in general, possible for all axioms but we show that this 'issue' can to a large extent be alleviated. Moreover, we have performed an experimental evaluation with many well-known ontologies which showed that such axioms are not used so often in practice. {\textcopyright} The British Computer Society 2015.

abstract = {To provide context-based personalized services utilizing smart
appliances in a smart home environment, we propose a framework for
PersonAlized Service disCovery Using FuZZY-based CBR and Context
Ontology (PASCUZZY). Basically, the PASCUZZY framework is implemented on
case-based context ontology. To generate and manage the case instances
on the case-based context ontology, we adopt the fuzzy set theory to
transpose numerical-type context data sensed from the surrounding
environment. The context is transposed to linguistic-type context
instances on the context ontology. In addition, to formalize and manage
the context and services as multi-attributed data, the context ontology
was developed reflecting the structure of cases borrowed from case-based
reasoning. Furthermore, we propose adaptation methods to adjust the
generic fuzzy membership functions depending on the inhabitants'
context. It is performed by modifying the values of the membership
number and/or modifying the numbers of the linguistic terms that are
based on the inhabitants' context to affect the membership numbers. The
adapted membership functions return the personalized degree of
memberships depending on the specialized context of a specific fuzzy
variable. Inevitably, the number of cases on the case-based context
ontology will be increased from time to time. We apply Ward's method not
only to reduce the search effort via a hierarchical clustering on the
case-based context ontology but also to find the most similar service as
a solution to the new context. To verify the superiority of the PASCUZZY
framework, we perform two kinds of evaluations. First, we evaluate the
effectiveness of the adaptation of the fuzzy membership functions.
Second, we verify the effectiveness of the application of a clustering
method to the case instances of the case-based context ontology to
identify the most similar service. Results of the experiment verified

abstract = {We propose an ontology alignment framework with two core features: the
use of background knowledge and the ability to handle vagueness in the
matching process and the resulting concept alignments. The procedure is
based on the use of a generic reference vocabulary, which is used for
fuzzifying the ontologies to be matched. The choice of this vocabulary
is problem-dependent in general, although Wikipedia represents a
general-purpose source of knowledge that can be used in many cases, and
even allows cross language matchings. In the first step of our approach,
each domain concept is represented as a fuzzy set of reference concepts.
In the next step, the fuzzified domain concepts are matched to one
another, resulting in fuzzy descriptions of the matches of the original
concepts. Based on these concept matches, we propose an algorithm that
produces a merged fuzzy ontology that captures what is common to the
source ontologies. The paper describes experiments in the domain of
multimedia by using ontologies containing tagged images, as well as an
evaluation of the approach in an information retrieval setting. The
undertaken fuzzy approach has been compared to a classical crisp
alignment by the help of a ground truth that was created based on human

abstract = {In the era of Web 2.0, there has been an explosive growth of
consumer-contributed comments at social media and electronic commerce
Web sites. Applying state-of-the-art social analytics methodology to
analyze the sentiments embedded in these consumer comments facilitates
both firms' product design strategies and individual consumers'
comparison shopping. However, existing social analytics methods often
adopt coarse-grained and context-free sentiment analysis approaches.
Consequently, these methods may not be effective enough to support firms
and consumers' demands of fine-grained extraction of market intelligence
from social media. Guided by the design science research methodology,
the main contribution of our research is the design of a novel social
analytics methodology that can leverage the sheer volume of consumer
reviews archived at social media sites to perform a fine-grained
extraction of market intelligence. More specifically, the proposed
social analytics methodology is underpinned by a novel semi-supervised
fuzzy product ontology mining algorithm. Evaluated based on real-world
social media data, our prototype system shows remarkable performance
improvement over a baseline ontology learning system and a context-free
sentiment analysis system. The managerial implication of our research is
that firms can apply the proposed social analytics methodology to tap
into the collective social intelligence on the Web, and hence improve
their product design and marketing strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Semantic annotation is at the core of Semantic Web technology: it
bridges the gap between legacy non-semantic web resource descriptions
and their elicited, formally specified conceptualization, converting
syntactic structures into knowledge structures, i.e., ontologies. Most
existing approaches and tools are designed to deal with manual or
semi-/automatic semantic annotation that exploits available ontologies
through the pattern-based discovery of concepts. This work aims to
generate the automatic semantic annotation of web resources, without any
prefixed ontological support. The novelty of our approach is that,
starting from web resources, content with a high-level of abstraction is
obtained: concepts, connections between concepts, and
instance-population are identified and arranged into an ex-novo
ontology. The framework is designed to process resources from different
sources (textual information, images, etc.) and generate an
ontology-based annotation. A data-driven analysis reveals the data and
their intrinsic relationships (in the form of triples) extracted from
the resource content. On the basis of the discovered semantics,
corresponding concepts and properties are modeled, allowing an ad hoc
ontology to be built through an OWL-based coding annotation. The benefit
of this approach is the generation of knowledge structured in a quite
automatic way (i.e., the human support is restricted to the
configuration of some parameters). The approach exploits a fuzzy
extension of the mathematical modeling of Formal Concept Analysis and
Relational Concept Analysis to generate the ontological structure of
data resources.},

incorporates visual, conceptual, contextual and spatial knowledge about

Indeed, our approach uses visual and conceptual information to build a

Contextual and spatial information about image concepts are then
computed and incorporated in the ontology in order to model richer
semantic relationships between these concepts. Fuzzy description logics
are used as a formalism to represent our ontology and the inherent
uncertainty and imprecision of this kind of information. Subsequently,
we propose a new approach for image annotation based on hierarchical
image classification and a multi-stage reasoning framework for reasoning
about the consistency of the produced annotation. In this approach,
fuzzy ontological reasoning is used in order to achieve a semantically

applications to achieve proper ambient assisted living. There has been
remarkable progress in this domain, but some challenges still remain to
obtain robust methods. Our goal in this work is to provide a system that
allows the modeling and recognition of a set of complex activities in
real life scenarios involving interaction with the environment. The
proposed framework is a hybrid model that comprises two main modules: a
low level sub-activity recognizer, based on data-driven methods, and a
high-level activity recognizer, implemented with a fuzzy ontology to
include the semantic interpretation of actions performed by users. The
fuzzy ontology is fed by the sub-activities recognized by the low level
data-driven component and provides fuzzy ontological reasoning to
recognize both the activities and their influence in the environment
with semantics. An additional benefit of the approach is the ability to
handle vagueness and uncertainty in the knowledge-based module, which
substantially outperforms the treatment of incomplete and/or imprecise
data with respect to classic crisp ontologies. We validate these
advantages with the public CAD-120 dataset (Cornell Activity Dataset),
achieving an accuracy of 90.1{\%} and 91.07{\%} for low-level and high-level

logs of network connection, registry, and memory from the operation
system on the physical-virtual hybrid analysis environment to get and
extract more unknown malicious behavior information. The important
information is then extracted to construct the ontology model by using
the Web Ontology Language and Fuzzy Markup Language. Additionally, MiT
is also able to automatically provide and share samples and reports via
the cloud storage mechanism; (2) apply the techniques of Interval Type-2
Fuzzy Set to construct the malware analysis domain knowledge, namely the
Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Malware Ontology (IT2FMO), for malware behavior
analysis. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can
effectively execute the malware behavior analysis, and the constructed

abstract = {In recent times, Body Area Networks (BANs) are rising as one of the major research topics, predominantly in the field of individual health monitoring. In view of the fact that health data are secretive and sensitive details, the security of data transmission inside a BAN turns out to be a significant issue that needs instantaneous attention. Here, a novel signcryption scheme based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for body area network security is proposed. Initially the BANs are the flexibility with which patients can share, expand and adjust the system in accordance with sensors, data and functionality. The initial step is to build up an interoperable platform with open interfaces, which looks after common management tasks. Moreover, interoperability is defined through semantics. In order to considerably enhance the semantic interoperability between sensor networks and applications the Fuzzy Ontology (FO) based approach is used. The patient‘s database is based on this interoperability because third parties to formulate system modules that can be joined together with the platform without difficulty. Then the ECC based security mechanism is makes an appropriate tradeoff between security and elasticity. It integrates digital signatures and encryption, and gives confidentiality, unforgeability, authenticity and collusion resistance. Theoretically it proves that ECC is efficient and feasible. And also its security level is analyzed in practical BANs. {\textcopyright} Research India Publications.},

Open standards, such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), have contributed to expand its adoption, but they have limited capabilities for cross-domain information integration and query. To address these challenges, the Linked Building Data initiative promotes the use of ontologies and Semantic Web technologies in order to create more formal and interoperable BIMs. In this paper, we present a fuzzy logic-based extension of such semantic BIMs that provides support for imprecise knowledge representation and retrieval. We propose an expressive fuzzy ontology language, and describe how to use a fuzzy reasoning engine in a BIM context with selected examples. The resulting fuzzy semantic BIM enables new functionalities in the project design and analysis stages - namely, soft integration of cross-domain knowledge, flexible BIM query, and imprecise parametric modeling. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A new approach for automatic generation of Fuzzy Ontology of Data Mining (FODM), through the combination of conceptual clustering, fuzzy logic and FCA will be presented. Then, a new algorithm to support database flexible querying using the generated fuzzy ontology will be defined. The approach starts with the organization of the data in homogeneous clusters having common properties which allows to deduce the data's semantic. Then, it models these clusters by an extension of the FCA. This lattice will be used to build a core of ontology. This ontology will be represented, then, as a set of fuzzy rules as an efficient answers to flexible queries.

abstract = {The volume of traveling websites is rapidly increasing. This makes
relevant information extraction more challenging. Several fuzzy
ontology-based systems have been proposed to decrease the manual work of
a full-text query search engine and opinion mining. However, most search
engines are keyword-based, and available full-text search engine systems
are still imperfect at extracting precise information using different
types of user queries. In opinion mining, travelers do not declare their
hotel opinions entirely but express individual feature opinions in
reviews. Hotel reviews have numerous uncertainties, and most featured
opinions are based on complex linguistic wording (small, big, very good
and very bad). Available ontology-based systems cannot extract blurred
information from reviews to provide better solutions. To solve these
problems, this paper proposes a new extraction and opinion mining system
based on a type-2 fuzzy ontology called T2FOBOMIE. The system
reformulates the user's full-text query to extract the user requirement
and convert it into the format of a proper classical full-text search
engine query. The proposed system retrieves targeted hotel reviews and
extracts feature opinions from reviews using a fuzzy domain ontology.
The fuzzy domain ontology, user information and hotel information are
integrated to form a type-2 fuzzy merged ontology for the retrieving of
feature polarity and individual hotel polarity. The Prot,g, OWL-2
(Ontology Web Language) tool is used to develop the type-2 fuzzy
ontology. A series of experiments were designed and demonstrated that
T2FOBOMIE performance is highly productive for analyzing reviews and
accurate opinion mining.},

abstract = {This paper aims to incorporate a knowledge discovery technique into the
Proximity-based Logic Programming paradigm in order to generate
background knowledge (conceptual hierarchies) in a semi-automatic way
which may lead to an efficient and desirable abstraction process among
the symbols (representing concepts) from a first-order language and to
the discovery of generalized relationship among them i.e. a logic-based
framework with the capability of abstraction. This method makes use of
the concept of.-block characterizing the notion of equivalence when
working with proximity relations. When the universe of discourse is
composed of concepts which are related by proximity, the sets of.-blocks
extracted from that proximity relation can be seen as hierarchical sets
of concepts grouped by abstraction level. Then, each group (forming
a.-block) can be labeled, with user help, by means of a more general
descriptor in order to simulate a generalization process based on
proximity. Thanks to this process, the system can learn concepts that
were unknown initially and reply to queries that it was not able to
answer. The novelty of this work is that it is the first time a method,
with analogous features to the one aforementioned, is implemented inside
a fuzzy logic programming framework. Certainly, in order to check the
feasibility of the method, we have developed a software tool which have
been integrated into the Bousi similar to Prolog system. Finally, this
work presents a method to get a set of recommended abstract descriptors
by using WordNet. This allows to improve the original generalization
mechanism, helping the user in the task of selecting a convenient
abstraction. Also, the overall method can be seen as a technique that
facilitates the tuning of term ontologies.},

superior or at least equal to the result which is derived from previous
methods. With the proposed method in this paper, feature similarities of
modules between a new tooling ontology and each similar tooling ontology
are calculated by fuzzy similarity measurement, and the MSMs are
restructured to form a new tooling model after conflict resolution. A
case study on forming mould is provided to illustrate the applications
and prove the higher similarity by comparing with CBR. The proposed

an automated tool for formalizing fuzzy object-oriented database (FOOD)
models using fuzzy ontologies (i.e., constructing fuzzy ontologies from
FOOD models), and investigate how to apply the constructed fuzzy
ontologies to reason on FOOD models. Firstly, we propose a complete
formal definition of FOOD models, which considers most features of FOOD
models. On this basis, we propose an approach for constructing fuzzy
ontologies from FOOD models. The approach can transform FOOD models
(including schema and object instance information) into fuzzy
ontologies. We also give full proof of correctness of the construction
approach, and provide a full construction example. Furthermore, we
implement a prototype tool called FOOD2FOnto, which can automatically
construct fuzzy ontologies from FOOD models. Some tests demonstrate that
our approach actually works. Finally, the constructed fuzzy ontologies
are used to reason on the FOOD models, and some reasoning rules and a
reasoning example are provided.},

abstract = {With the growing availability and popularity of online reviews,
consumers' opinions towards certain products or services are generated
and spread over the Internet; sentiment analysis thus arises in response
to the requirement of opinion seekers. Most prior studies are concerned
with statistics-based methods for sentiment classification. These
methods, however, suffer from weak comprehension of text-based messages
at semantic level, thus resulting in low accuracy. We propose an
ontology-based opinion-aware framework - EOSentiMiner - to conduct
sentiment analysis for Chinese online reviews from a semantic
perspective. The emotion space model is employed to express emotions of
reviews in the EOSentiMiner, where sentiment words are classified into
two types: emotional words and evaluation words. Furthermore, the former
contains eight emotional classes, and the latter is divided into two
opinion evaluation classes. An emotion ontology model is then built
based on HowNet to express emotion in a fuzzy way. Based on emotion
ontology, we evaluate some factors possibly affecting sentiment
classification including features of products (services), emotion
polarity and intensity, degree words, negative words, rhetoric and
punctuation. Finally, sentiment calculation based on emotion ontology is
proposed from sentence level to document level. We conduct experiments
by using the data from online reviews of cellphone and wedding
photography. The result shows the EOSentiMiner outperforms baseline
methods in term of accuracy. We also find that emotion expression forms
and connection relationship vary across different domains of review
corpora.},

learners. The learners search the web to gather knowledge about a
particular topic from the information in the repositories. Retrieval of
relevant materials from a domain can be easily implemented if the
information is organized and related in some way. Ontologies are a key
concept that helps us to relate information for providing the more
relevant lessons to the learner. This paper proposes an adaptive
e-Learning system, which generates a user specific e-Learning content by
comparing the concepts with more than one system using similarity
measures. A cross ontology measure is defined, which consists of fuzzy
domain ontology as the primary ontology and the domain expert's ontology
as the secondary ontology, for the comparison process. A personalized
document is provided to the user with a user profile, which includes the
data obtained from the processing of the proposed method under a User
score, which is obtained through the user evaluation. The results of the
proposed e-Learning system under the designed cross ontology similarity
measure show a significant increase in performance and accuracy under
different conditions. The assessment of the comparative analysis, showed
the difference in performance of our proposed method over other methods.
Based on the assessment results it is proved that the proposed approach

abstract = {The volume of obstacles encountered in the marine environment is rapidly
increasing, which makes the development of collision avoidance systems
more challenging. Several fuzzy ontology-based simulators have been
proposed to provide a virtual platform for the analysis of maritime
missions. However, due to the simulators' limitations, ontology-based
knowledge cannot be utilized to evaluate maritime robot algorithms and
to avoid collisions. The existing simulators must be equipped with smart
semantic domain knowledge to provide an efficient framework for the
decision-making system of AUVs. This article presents type-2 fuzzy
ontology-based semantic knowledge (T2FOBSK) and a simulator for marine
users that will reduce experimental time and the cost of marine robots
and will evaluate algorithms intelligently. The system reformulates the
user's query to extract the positions of AUVs and obstacles and convert
them to a proper format for the simulator. The simulator uses semantic
knowledge to calculate the degree of collision risk and to avoid
obstacles. The available type-1 fuzzy ontology-based approach cannot
extract intensively blurred data from the hazy marine environment to
offer actual solutions. Therefore, we propose a type-2 fuzzy ontology to
provide accurate information about collision risk and the marine
environment during real-time marine operations. Moreover, the type-2
fuzzy ontology is designed using Protege OWL-2 tools. The DL query and
SPARQL query are used to evaluate the ontology. The distance to closest
point of approach (DCPA), time to closest point of approach (TCPA) and
variation of compass degree (VCD) are used to calculate the degree of
collision risk between AUVs and obstacles. The experimental and
simulation results show that the proposed architecture is highly
efficient and highly productive for marine missions and the real-time
decision-making system of AUVs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

which is now widely applied in distributed and dynamic environments such

disseminating the real world knowledge for effective human computer
interactions. However, engineering of domain ontologies is very labor
intensive and time consuming. Some machine learning methods have been
explored for automatic or semi-automatic discovery of domain ontologies.
Nevertheless, both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of
these methods need to be improved. While constructing large scale
ontology for real-world applications such as e-learning, the ability to
monitor the progress of students' learning performance is a critical
issue. In this paper, a system is proposed for analyzing students'
knowledge level obtained using Kolb's classification based on the
students level of understanding and their learning style using cluster
analysis. This system uses fuzzy logic and clustering algorithms to
arrange their documents according to the level of their performance.
Moreover, a new domain ontology discovery method is proposed uses
contextual information of the knowledge sources from the e-Learning
domain. This proposed system constructs ontology to provide an effective
assistance in e-Learning. The proposed ontology discovery method has
been empirically tested in an e-Learning environment for teaching the
subject Database Management Systems. The salient contributions of this
paper are the use of Jaccard Similarity measure and K-Means clustering
algorithm for clustering of learners and the use of ontology for concept
understanding and learning style identification. This helps in adaptive

abstract = {Fuzzy ontologies allow the modeling of real world environments using fuzzy sets mathematical environment and linguistic modeling. Therefore, fuzzy ontologies become really useful when the information that is worked with is imprecise. This happens a lot in real world environments because humans are more used to think using imprecise nature words instead of numbers. Furthermore, there is a high amount of concepts that, because of their own nature, cannot be measured numerically. Moreover, due to the fact that linguistic information is extracted from different sources and is represented using different linguistic term sets, to deal with it can be problematic. In this paper, three different novel approaches that can help us to build and manage fuzzy ontologies using heterogeneous linguistic information are proposed. Advantages and drawbacks of all of the new proposed approaches are exposed. Thanks to the use of multi-granular fuzzy linguistic methods, information can be expressed using different linguistic term sets. Multi-granular fuzzy linguistic methods can also allow users to choose the linguistic term sets that they prefer to formulate their queries. In such a way, user-computer communication is improved since users feel more comfortable when using the system.},

abstract = {Objective
Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a problem-solving paradigm that uses past knowledge to interpret or solve new problems. It is suitable for experience-based and theory-less problems. Building a semantically intelligent CBR that mimic the expert thinking can solve many problems especially medical ones.
Methods
Knowledge-intensive CBR using formal ontologies is an evolvement of this paradigm. Ontologies can be used for case representation and storage, and it can be used as a background knowledge. Using standard medical ontologies, such as SNOMED CT, enhances the interoperability and integration with the health care systems. Moreover, utilizing vague or imprecise knowledge further improves the CBR semantic effectiveness. This paper proposes a fuzzy ontology-based CBR framework. It proposes a fuzzy case-base OWL2 ontology, and a fuzzy semantic retrieval algorithm that handles many feature types.
Material
This framework is implemented and tested on the diabetes diagnosis problem. The fuzzy ontology is populated with 60 real diabetic cases. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a set of experiments and case studies.
Results
The resulting system can answer complex medical queries related to semantic understanding of medical concepts and handling of vague terms. The resulting fuzzy case-base ontology has 63 concepts, 54 (fuzzy) object properties, 138 (fuzzy) datatype properties, 105 fuzzy datatypes, and 2640 instances. The system achieves an accuracy of 97.67{\%}. We compare our framework with existing CBR systems and a set of five machine-learning classifiers; our system outperforms all of these systems.
Conclusion
Building an integrated CBR system can improve its performance. Representing CBR knowledge using the fuzzy ontology and building a case retrieval algorithm that treats different features differently improves the accuracy of the resulting systems.},

abstract = {Many different real-world applications with a high-level of uncertainty
proved the good performance of the type-2 fuzzy sets (T2 FSs). Balanced
diet means that the intake of each necessary nutrient meets its adequate
demand and actual caloric intake balances with calories burned.
Additionally, making a diversity of choice from various types of food is
also essential to reduce the risk of developing various chronic
diseases. Different people have a different goal and it is hard to
measure how healthy the eaten meal is for those who are not the domain
experts on the diet. This paper presents an adaptive personalized diet
linguistic recommendation mechanism based on type-2 fuzzy logic system
(T2 FLS) and genetic fuzzy markup language (GFML). First, an adaptive
dietary assessment and recommendation ontology is constructed by domain
experts, and then a T2 FS-based GFML, describing the fuzzy knowledge
base and the fuzzy rule base of the proposed mechanism, is evolved by
using genetic algorithms. Next, a T2 FS-based fuzzy inference mechanism
infers the result of the dietary health level based on the evolved
type-2 GFML (T2GFML). In addition, the balanced computation mechanism is
also proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the T2 FLS for
the diet domain knowledge. Finally, the linguistic knowledge discovery
mechanism presents the discovered linguistic meaning about the meal's
health level to show the involved subjects how to make a personalized
diet linguistic recommendation. This type of information about the eaten
meal can provide the subjects with a reference to gradually improve
their unhealthy eating habit and then become healthier and healthier.
Experimental results show that the results of the proposed mechanism for
the T2 FLS are better than those for the type-1 fuzzy logic system (T1
FLS).},

abstract = {Remote sensing images have been widely used by intelligence analysts to
discover geospatial features. The overwhelming volume of remote sensing
imagery requires automated methods or systems for feature discovery.
Existing research focuses on automatic extraction of isolated or
elementary features, such as buildings and roads. It is rather
understudied to discover complex geospatial features, which is spatially
composed of elementary features. From the e-Science perspective, service
computing technologies have shown great promise for widespread
automation of data analysis and computation. The discovery of complex
features would benefit from service computing technologies by computing
spatial relations and their fuzziness among elementary features using
geoprocessing services. The discovery process can be automated using an
ontology approach. The paper presents how ontologies for complex
geospatial features, enriched with fuzzy sets of spatial relations, can
automate the workflow generation. Spatial computation functions, fuzzy
membership functions, and mathematical fuzzy logical operators, are
provided as services, and plugged into workflows on demand to enjoy the
benefits of service computing technologies. A prototype system
demonstrates on-demand uncertainty-aware detection of complex geospatial
features in a geoprocessing service environment.},

abstract = {In many industrial contexts, knowledge and data provided by experts are imprecise as there seems to be an understanding that “experts do not need precise details as they understand anyway what is meant”. The imprecision inherent in the knowledge that experts acquire in their practice require decision support tools that can be tailored to the specific application contexts to aid complex decisions. As a specific example, expert knowledge expressed in linguistic terms is not precisely structured and concepts are not defined specifically enough in order to be easy to use and process. If we want to represent and use expert knowledge for knowledge-based systems on a general level, that is easily adaptable, we need to find ways to represent and process knowledge elements; our approach is to use interval-valued fuzzy sets, fuzzy ontology and aggregation operators. We show that these instruments will offer us a novel approach for aggregation of imprecise data to obtain actionable knowledge to aid complex decisions. The framework is described and the approach is shown through the context of a fuzzy wine ontology; the problem formulation resembles many features of important and complex decision making problems found in different industries. We describe the potential application of the framework in the case of paper machine maintenance. A web-based application is introduced to better demonstrate the benefits decision-makers can receive from the proposed framework. Additionally, we present an approach to utilize the framework in finding consensual solutions in situations involving several experts.},

of knowledge representation in semantic web. In this paper, two main
kinds of common fuzzy knowledge are sorted out, and there is a great
significance for ontology representation of common fuzzy knowledge in

common operation of semantic web, but heterogeneous ontologies seriously
affect accuracy of information retrieval, and ontology mapping is the
key to solve the problem. Therefore, in this paper, firstly an ontology
representation method of common fuzzy knowledge is presented. Common
fuzzy knowledge is polytypic and includes most commonly used fuzzy
knowledge in reality. So fuzzy sets and Cloud Model are used to reflect
and represent these 2 types of common fuzzy knowledge in ontology. Then,
based on the ontology representation method of common fuzzy knowledge
mentioned above, a corresponding algorithm of ontology mapping is
presented, which is based on similarity calculation of concepts and
Support Vector Machine. The proposed methods extend the scope of
ontology application and are significant for information retrieval of
fuzzy knowledge in the semantic web. The experiments show that the
proposed methods are practicable and effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we extend non-scalar attribute management in fuzzy queries with the use of ontologies. Thus, we allow to compute this kind of queries not only with the similarity relationships defined explicitly on a fuzzy set but with semantically interrelated terms modeled as a domain ontology as well. Moreover, we present the architecture of a novel system that combines both techniques to return an answer as much complete as possible and ordered by a degree of accomplishment.

abstract = {Advanced automation requires complex robotic systems that are susceptible to mechanical, software and sensory failures. While bespoke solutions exist to avoid such situations, there is a requirement to develop generic robotic framework that can allow autonomous recovery from anomalous conditions through hardware or software reconfiguration. This paper presents a novel robotic architecture that combines fuzzy reasoning with ontology-based deliberative decision making to enable self-reconfigurability within a complex robotic system architecture. The fuzzy reasoning module incorporates multiple types of fuzzy inference models that passively monitor the constituent sub-systems for any anomalous changes. Aresponse is generated in retrospect of this monitoring process that is sent to an Ontology-based rational agent in order to perform system reconfiguration. A reconfiguration routine is generated to maintain optimal performance within such complex architectures. The current research work will apply the proposed framework to the problem of autonomous visual navigation of unmanned ground vehicles. An increase in system performance is observed every time a reconfiguration routine is triggered. Experimental analysis is carried out using real-world data, concluding that the proposed system concept gives superior performance against non-reconfigurable robotic frameworks. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

diseases, such as obesity or diabetes. Making improvements in terms of
diet and physical activity is helpful for people to reduce the risk of
suffering from these chronic diseases. This paper presents a healthy
diet assessment mechanism based on fuzzy markup language (FML) for
Japanese food. This mechanism is based on the dietary standard, food
exchange list (FEL), published by the Japan Diabetes Society, to assess
one person's dietary healthy level according to his/her personal
profile, his/her daily physical activity, and how balanced he/she
consumes food items. We use FML to describe the knowledge base and the
rule base of the constructed fuzzy logic system. Additionally, ontology
stores the necessary knowledge base and rule base of the adopted fuzzy
inference mechanism. The proposed mechanism operates as follows: (i)
Dieticians first define the nutrient facts of the collected food items.
(ii) The involved subjects record their personal information, eaten food
items, and daily physical activity. Through the constructed FML-based
personal profile ontology, the estimated energy requirement and the
estimated unit requirement for each food group are obtained after
inference. (iii) Finally, one-day dietary healthy level is inferred by
the proposed fuzzy inference mechanism. From the experimental results,
the proposed mechanism is feasible to apply to Japanese dietary
assessment. In the future, we will integrate with genetic learning

The aim of this paper was to develop a GEographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) approach, by integrating Deep Learning classification and Fuzzy Ontologies through multi-scale analysis, to monitor building changes in suburban areas of Greece. Three suburban areas of east Attica, Greece were selected as representative to test the methodology. For each area, one QuickBird and one WorldView 2 image, taken in 2006 and 2011, respectively, were employed. Three segmentation levels and a three-level class hierarchy were developed for the extraction process. Deep Belief Networks were employed on the lowest level of the segmentation hierarchy (Level 1) for an initial detection of areas of possible change. To detect the changes in building infrastructure, the classification result of Level 1 was refined based on interpretation rules, developed on the upper levels of the hierarchy (Level 2 and Level 3). Accuracy assessment indicated that 93.5{\%} of the total number of changes were successfully detected, while the commission error was less than 20{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2016 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to detect these attacks. The main drawback of the traditional IDSs is the usage of some specific language, to define the rules. To overcome the drawback, a self-learning ontology is used to update the rules according to the new types of attacks. This paper presents an Ontology-based Multi-Agent Model Intrusion Detection System (OMAMIDS) for detecting web service attacks. The attacker rules are generated using the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Logic (IFL). The sniffing agent is used to monitor the network behavior and an analysis agent is used to select the set of required information from the sniffed data. It detects the behavior of the request, whether it is normal or abnormal. If the behavior is normal, request processing is enabled. Otherwise, the packet is forwarded to the decision agent. The decision agent includes globally shared rules of the attacker, for taking actions related to the severity level of the detected attack. The proposed system achieves high detection rate and accuracy and lower false positive rate than the existing techniques. {\textcopyright} 2016 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

The main objective of this paper was to present an ontology with a highly matching grade of proeminent medical concepts able to analyze the patient's descriptive medical condition. Focusing on semantic pain descriptors and weight spreading techniques, we proposed a semantic-pseudo-fuzzy engine entitled SEPHYRES, with which we tried to present an ontology-based solution using not only a generic semantic reasoner but also complementary domain-heuristic reasoning. Having applied the valid evidence-based references along with local experts, we illustrated how the resilient expressive model represents the complex medical term relations. The twenty test cases were extracted from the MEDSCAPE and PubMed databases and the precision and recall were calculated. Finally, the results were compared against the Isabel symptom checker and performed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The recall measures indicated that the accuracy was equal to 75{\%}, if the system was adjusted to only ten results as differential diagnoses. Moreover, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that there was significant difference between SEPHYRES and Isabel symptom checker (P= 0.016) so that this method is sufficiently able to improve semantic expressiveness in both professional medical diagnosis and patient decision aid systems. {\textcopyright} 2010, Romanian Society for Applied Medical Informatics.

preferences for the features of products but cannot retrieve the causes
of the preferences. Previous sentiment analysis methods used sentiment
words to calculate the sentiment polarity for specific features but
could not utilize neutral sentiment words, even when they constituted a
large proportion of the sentiment words. Fault diagnosis can extract
causes and determine the root cause by using factual information and the
cause-effect relation, but is not used for sentiment data. For the
retrieval of sentiment root causes, we propose a sentiment root cause
analysis method for user preferences. We consider sentiment relations
based on fuzzy formal concept analysis (FFCA) to extend hierarchical
feature-level sentiment analysis. A hierarchical relation of neutral
sentiment words and explicit causal relation based on causal
conjunctions is utilized to retrieve the cross features of root causes.
A sentiment root cause is determined from the extracted causes to
explain the preference of a sentiment expression by using a fuzzy
cognitive map with a relations method. We demonstrate a factual ontology
and sentiment ontology based on a feature ontology for clothing
products. We evaluated the proposed sentiment root cause analysis method
and verified that it is improved as compared with term frequency-based

execution. This work focuses on the definition of a framework to support

to the involved decision makers also in the case when more general or

results reveal that the proposed weight learning algorithm and the
considered initial weight association strategies (Starting Weight and

heterogeneous data sources, several methods have been introduced in
literature. Nevertheless, few of them have been interested in decreasing
the problem complexity and reducing the research space of
correspondences between the input ontologies.This paper presents a new
approach for ontology alignment based on the ontology knowledge mining.
The latter consists on producing for each ontology a hierarchical
structure of fuzzy conceptual clusters, where a concept can belong to
several clusters simultaneously. Each level of the hierarchy reflects
the knowledge granularity degree of the knowledge base in order to
improve the effectiveness and speediness of the information retrieval.
Actually, such method allows the knowledge granularity analyze between
the ontologies and facilitates several ontology engineering techniques.
The ontology alignment process is performed iteratively over the
produced hierarchical structure of the fuzzy clusters using semantic
techniques. Once the correspondent clusters are identified, we consider
both syntactic and structural characteristics of their correspondent
entities. The proposed approach has been tested over the OAEI benchmark
dataset and some real mammographic ontologies since this work is a part
of CMCU project for Mammographic images analysis for Assistance

TMR supports the function of retrieving various media types such as image, video, audio and text by using a single media type. Firstly, semantic fields are extracted from the user annotating and automatic learning to express the users׳ intention. Secondly, ontology is used to represent the semantic fields of a media, and the ontology represented semantic information is saved together with the media document data. Thirdly, the semantic field adjustment process is described. Finally, fuzzy matching is employed to measure the similarity between the users׳ intention and media documents. For the returned results, we carry out the performance evaluation models in comparison with the existing approaches.

abstract = {With the rapidly growing number of available Cloud services, to fulfill the need for ordinary users to select accurate services has become a significant challenge. However, as a Cloud service environment encompasses many uncertainties that may hinder users to make sound decisions, it is highly desirable to handle fuzzy information when choosing a suitable service in an uncertain environment. In this paper, we present a novel fuzzy decision-making framework that improves the existing Cloud service selection techniques. In particular, we build a fuzzy ontology to model uncertain relationships between objects in databases for service matching, and present a novel analytic hierarchy process approach to calculate the semantic similarity between concepts. We also present a multi-criteria decision-making technique to rank Cloud services. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy ontology-based similarity matching. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Cloud computing enables a revolutionary paradigm of consuming ICT services. However, due to the inadequately described service information, users often feel confused while trying to find the optimal services. Although some approaches are proposed to deal with cloud service retrieval and recommendation issues, they would only work for certain restricted scenarios in dealing with basic service specifications. Indeed, the missing extent is that most of the cloud services are “agile” whilst there are many vague service terms and descriptions. This paper proposes an agility-oriented and fuzziness-embedded cloud service ontology model, which adopts agility-centric design along with OWL2 (Web Ontology Language) fuzzy extensions. The captured cloud service specifications are maintained in an open and collaborative manner, as the fuzziness in the model accepts rating updates from users on the fly. The model enables comprehensive service specification by capturing cloud concept details and their interactions, even across multiple service categories and abstraction levels. Utilizing the model as a knowledge base, a service recommendation system prototype is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the approach can outperform existing practices by achieving effective service search, retrieval and recommendation outcomes.},

abstract = {With the explosion of Social media, Opinion mining has been used rapidly in recent years. However, a few studies focused on the precision rate of feature review's and opinion word's extraction. These studies do not come with any optimum mechanism of supplying required precision rate for effective opinion mining. Most of these studies are based on Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and classical ontology. These systems are still imperfect for classifying the feature reviews into more degrees of polarity terms (strong negative, negative, neutral, positive and strong positive). Further, the existing classical ontology-based systems cannot extract blurred information from reviews; thus, it provides poor results. In this regard, this paper proposes a robust classification technique for feature review's identification and semantic knowledge for opinion mining based on SVM and Fuzzy Domain Ontology (FDO). The proposed system retrieves a collection of reviews about hotel and hotel features. The SVM identifies hotel feature reviews and filter out irrelevant reviews (noises) and the FDO is then used to compute the polarity term of each feature. The amalgamation of FDO and SVM significantly increases the precision rate of review's and opinion word's extraction and accuracy of opinion mining. The FDO and intelligent prototype are developed using Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} OWL-2 (Ontology Web Language) tool and JAVA, respectively. The experimental result shows considerable performance improvement in feature review's classification and opinion mining.},

For classification of customer reviews we extract the information from the reviews based on the context given by users. We use text mining techniques to tag the review and extract context. Then we find out the relationship between the contexts from the ontological database. We incorporate fuzzy based semantic analyzer to find the relationship between the review and the context when they are not found therein. The sentence based classification predicts the relevant reviews, whereas the fuzzy based context method predicts the relevant instances among the relevant reviews. Textual analysis is carried out with the combination of association rules and ontology mining.

abstract = {Traffic congestion is rapidly increasing in urban areas, particularly in mega cities. To date, there exist a few sensor network based systems to address this problem. However, these techniques are not suitable enough in terms of monitoring an entire transportation system and delivering emergency services when needed. These techniques require real-time data and intelligent ways to quickly determine traffic activity from useful information. In addition, these existing systems and websites on city transportation and travel rely on rating scores for different factors (e.g., safety, low crime rate, cleanliness, etc.). These rating scores are not efficient enough to deliver precise information, whereas reviews or tweets are significant, because they help travelers and transportation administrators to know about each aspect of the city. However, it is difficult for travelers to read, and for transportation systems to process, all reviews and tweets to obtain expressive sentiments regarding the needs of the city. The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing the information available on social network platforms and performing sentiment analysis. On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce inadequate results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based sentiment analysis and semantic web rule language (SWRL) rule-based decision-making to monitor transportation activities (accidents, vehicles, street conditions, traffic volume, etc.) and to make a city-feature polarity map for travelers. This system retrieves reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation activities. The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are developed by using Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} web ontology language (OWL) and Java, respectively. The experimental results show satisfactory improvement in tweet and review analysis and opinion mining. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

For better understanding of the content in the text collected from any online media, a proper methodology for the interpretation of useful information must be developed. This study offers a modified process of the text interpretation consisting of four stages with a preliminary stage of the text preprocessing and key phrase extraction using the annotated suffix tree (AST) technique and secondary stage of developing sparse clustering method named as iterative scaling of fuzzy additive spectral clustering (is-FADDIS) combined with a sharpening technique for grouping key phrases from the text. An ontology as the “knowledge base” was developed combining with is-FADDIS method as the third stage. Interpretation from the input text was carried out as the final stage of the text interpretation. The performances of is-FADDIS clustering combined with sharpening technique as high as 96 and 78{\%} were verified for some modeled sparse data and two specific real sparse data from two corpus, respectively, and could be better when comparing with Nonnegative Matrices Factorization (NMF) and K-means.

This paper focuses on the problems of the matching phase, which currently has exhaustive and heuristic approaches. While the exhaustive method has many matching errors, most of the matched pairs between the two ontologies are detected. The heuristic approach uses the ontology nature to trim the non-homologous pairs which can decrease significantly the number of mismatching pairs, but often skips lots of homologous element pairs. To overcome the disadvantages of the two approaches, we proposed to use the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) for modeling the ontology matching problem. In particular, we introduce constraints and suggest optimal function to minimize the matching errors. In the experiment, the mismatching pairs between ontologies are significantly reduced by applying CSP for refinement. {\textcopyright} 2017 ACCENTS.},

To detect the seismic activities in the coal mining environment, several techniques such as Bord and Pillar model, Bayesian Decision method etc., were introduced and carried out. In this paper, we have proposed anOntology aided Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) based feature correlation extraction technique for the multi attribute sensor data.Further, the Galactic Swarm Optimization (GSO) algorithm optimized Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used. The correlation extraction technique gives the better solution to determine the similarity between the semantically related heterogeneous sensor reading data and resolves the semantic ambiguity problem of heterogeneous sensors present in the coal mining Environment. {\textcopyright} 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

abstract = {Alluvial fan and bajada mapping is important for practical and economic importance to society. In this study, advanced geomorphometric, image processing and knowledge representation methods were investigated, enhanced and developed, towards the simultaneous identification of alluvial fans and bajadas. The developed method was based on the landform-pattern element approach. Data used included the 10 m spatial resolution National Elevation Dataset, provided by USGS and a pan-sharpened 15 m Landsat OLi imagery. The study area was located in the Death Valley, Nevada, USA. Digital Terrain Model (DTM) processing included noise-removal filtering and depression treatment. A two-phase GEographic Object-Based Image Analysis approach involving multi-scale segmentation and fuzzy ontology-based reasoning was designed. On the first phase, topographic forms were identified, by examining their morphometry and spatial relationships. On the second phase, the alluvial fans and bajadas were identified based on drainage pattern texture and topographic features such as landform shape. Due to a systematic omission on the fan toe outline, each fan and bajada spectral signature was taken into account to determine the omitted areas through region growing on the multispectral imagery. Accuracy assessment indicated satisfactory results, since a 90.3{\%} completeness and 88.8{\%} quality were achieved for both alluvial fans and bajadas. {\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

Many retrieval systems attempt to maintain the personalization of the information retrieved through the used search engines. Unfortunately, there are still many problems such as weak concepts representation, inaccurate of retrieved information, and vague retrieval systems. In this research, the fuzzy theory will be used hence; the fuzzy user model can be created. The fuzzy user model contains fuzzy concepts and fuzzy memberships for the acquired user profile which provide an efficient representation for text in addition to adaptive information retrieval. During the main process of the proposed user model acquiring, the document is represented by using the keyword and key phrase extraction. The acquired fuzzy user model is represented in ontological format to be reusable. Such adaptation is achieved by using user model that is based on fuzzy theory to infer fuzzy user modelling aspects. Finally, many advantages are expected from the proposed system such as flexible and reliable retrieval system, overcoming of traditional search engine problems, and reducing of the information retrieval process time. The system evaluation exploits 206 queries, which are generated during five users are searching and browsing the system. Using evaluation metrics; such as precision, recall, fall-out and f-measure, the experiments prove, that the proposed approach improves the accuracy retrieved information rather than other traditional approaches retrieving information. {\textcopyright} Research India Publications.},

integration of crowdsourced healthcare knowledge using
experience-ontologies. The purpose is to provide patients' healthcare
information which contains similar healthcare experiences including
conditions and symptoms and integrates the features and relations in the
particular patients' data according to users' queries. To do this, we
developed three modules and ontologies. The modules are Crowdsourced
Health Data Manipulation Module (CHMM), Health Ontology-based Relevant
Patient Finding Module (HRFM), and Ontology-guided Healthcare Knowledge
Integration Module (OKIM). CHMM is developed to transform patients' data
to structured cases with problem-solution. The cases are stored in CHEKC
Patient Ontology. HRFM is developed to find relevant cases according to
the user's query using CHEKC Upper Ontology. To do this, ensemble
semantic similarity is proposed using semantic similarity and fuzzy
C-means clustering and the relevant cases are stored in Interim
Ontology. OKIM is developed for the integration of the relevant cases
using SWRL rule-base. However, it is not guaranteed to find suitable

the problem, ontology-guided knowledge integration is proposed, which
supports the inferring relations among classes in CHEKC Interim

abstract = {Assessing semantic similarity is a fundamental requirement for many AI
applications. Crisp ontology (CO) is one of the knowledge representation
tools that can be used for this purpose. Thanks to the development of
semantic web, CO-based similarity assessment has become a popular
approach in recent years. However, in the presence of vague information,
CO cannot consider uncertainty of relations between concepts. On the
other hand, fuzzy ontology (FO) can effectively process uncertainty of
concepts and their relations. This paper aims at proposing an approach
for assessing concept similarity based on FO. The proposed approach
incorporates fuzzy relation composition in combination with an edge
counting approach to assess the similarity. Accordingly, proposed
measure relies on taxonomical features of an ontology in combination
with statistical features of concepts. Furthermore, an evaluation
approach for the FO-based similarity measure named as FOSE is proposed.
Considering social network data, proposed similarity measure is
evaluated using FOSE. The evaluation results prove the dominance of
proposed approach over its respective CO-based measure.},

abstract = {A virtual enterprise (VE) is a collaboration model between multiple
business partners in a value chain. The VE model is particularly
feasible and appropriate for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
and industrial parks containing multiple SMEs that have different
vertical competencies. The VE consortium's success highly depends on its
members. Therefore, it is crucial to select the most appropriate
enterprises when forming a VE consortium. In this study, a new
multi-agent hybrid partner selection algorithm is developed for
application in the development of an ontology-based multi-agent virtual
enterprise (OMAVE) system. In this platform, the agent's interactions
are supported by agent ontology, which provides concepts, properties and
all message formats for the agents. Different types of agents
collaborate and compete with each other so that unqualified or
inefficient enterprises are eliminated from the enterprise pool. Only
the remaining enterprises would be allowed to enter the negotiation
process and propose in the bidding. The agent-based auctioning platform
is coupled with a fuzzy-AHP-TOPSIS algorithm to evaluate partners based
on their proposals and background. Accordingly, the winning enterprise
for each task is identified and the whole project can be accomplished by
assigning tasks to the responsible partners. To test and verify the
functionality of the developed OMAVE system, a sample module using OMAVE

abstract = {The volume of adult content on the world wide web is increasing rapidly.
This makes an automatic detection of adult content a more challenging
task, when eliminating access to ill-suited websites. Most pornographic
webpage-filtering systems are based on n-gram, naive Bayes, K-nearest
neighbor, and keyword-matching mechanisms, which do not provide perfect
extraction of useful data from unstructured web content. These systems
have no reasoning capability to intelligently filter web content to
classify medical webpages from adult content webpages. In addition, it
is easy for children to access pornographic webpages due to the freely
available adult content on the Internet. It creates a problem for
parents wishing to protect their children from such unsuitable content.
To solve these problems, this paper presents a support vector machine
(SVM) and fuzzy ontology-based semantic knowledge system to
systematically filter web content and to identify and block access to
pornography. The proposed system classifies URLs into adult URLs and
medical URLs by using a blacklist of censored webpages to provide
accuracy and speed. The proposed fuzzy ontology then extracts web
content to find website type (adult content, normal, and medical) and
block pornographic content. In order to examine the efficiency of the
proposed system, fuzzy ontology, and intelligent tools are developed
using Protege 5.1 and Java, respectively. Experimental analysis shows
that the performance of the proposed system is efficient for
automatically detecting and blocking adult content.},

abstract = {Rapid increase in digital images demands effective and efficient image
retrieval systems. In text based image retrieval, images are annotated
with keywords based on human perception. A user query is composed of
keywords according to his/her requirements. Query keywords are matched
with the keywords associated with images, for retrieval. This process
has been extended with ontology to resolve semantic heterogeneities.
However, crisp annotation and retrieval processes could not produce the
desired results because both processes involve human perception. To
overcome this problem, we have proposed a retrieval system that makes
use of fuzzy ontology for improving retrieval performance. For modeling
the semantic description of an image, it is divided into regions in our
dataset and then regions are classified into concepts. The concepts are
combined into categories. The concepts, categories and images are linked
among themselves with fuzzy values in ontology. The retrieved results
are ranked based on the relevancy between the keywords of a query and
images. For evaluating the performance of the proposed methodology, we
have used both the objective and subjective measures. Experimental
results show that the proposed system performs better than the existing
systems in terms of retrieval performance.},

abstract = {An approach to performing linguistic summaries of graph datasets, with
particular focus on usage of ontologies is presented in this paper. This
well-known mining technique is based on fuzzy set theory, which is used
to model natural language words (e.g. `many', `tall'), and in
result-generates natural-like sentences describing the data. Although
intensely developed, before our work this method has been applied only
to relational databases, while more and more data is available in graph
model. A special case of such graph datasets is the Semantic Web, in
which ontologies provide meaning, therefore enabling advanced machine
learning. In our paper we analyze the problem of generating linguistic
summaries for a graph data case (for which the method cannot be directly
applied), with associated ontologies. The key element of ontologies are
concept hierarchies, which are the core of our work. Firstly, due to
heterogeneity and lack of schema we propose to use an ontological
concept (including all sub-concepts in hierarchy) as a subject for
summaries, and extract their attributes (neighboring vertexes). Then we
show that by ascending these ontological concept hierarchies (so by
attribute-based induction) we obtain additional, generalized summaries.
We showthis process for both summarizers and qualifiers, and propose an
extension to their respective imprecision measures -T-2 and T-9. We
perform two experiments on DBPedia-one for summary subject `Artist', and
second for `Musical Album'. For the latter, we show the optimized
process of obtaining the truth values using bottom-up approach.},

approach is one of the used methods for analyzing, discovering and

This paper proposes an approach for generating human-like fuzzy

process of extracting association rules from a huge database respecting
a predefined domain fuzzy ontology. Commonly, association rules mining
based on crisp ontology is found to be more flexible than classical ones
as it considers the relationships between concepts or items. Yet, crisp
ontology suffers from the problem of information losing resulted from
the rigid boundaries of crisp relationships, which are approximated to
be 0 or 1, between concepts. In contrast, the smooth boundaries of fuzzy
sets make it able to represent partial relationships that range from 0
to 1 between concepts in an ontology in a more flexible human-like
manner. Consequently, generating fuzzy association rules based on fuzzy
ontology makes it more human-like and reliable compared with other
previous ones. An illustrative case study, on two different data sets,
shows the added value of the proposed approach compared with some other

abstract = {This paper presents the evaluation of the level of usability of an intelligent monitoring and control interface for energy efficient management of public buildings, called BuildVis, which forms part of a Building Energy Management System (BEMS.) The BEMS ‘intelligence' is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions' which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential energy saving actions. As the usability of the system is seen as a key determinate to success, the paper evaluates the level of usability for both a set of technical users and also the FMs for five European buildings, providing analysis and lessons learned from the approach taken. {\textcopyright} 2017},

abstract = {Smart Grid (SG) systems are critical, intelligent infrastructure utility services connected through open networks that are potentially susceptible to cyber-attacks with very acute security risks of shutdown, loss of life, and loss of revenue. Traditional intrusion detection systems based on signature and anomaly techniques are no longer sufficient to protect SGs due to their new connectivity and management challenges, the ever-rapidly-evolving masquerades, and cyber criminality levied against them. SGs require cyber-security systems to render them resilient and protected through advanced Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) techniques and mechanisms. This paper proposes a smart collaborative advanced IDPS to provide the best possible protection of SGs with a fully distributed management structure that supports the network and host based detections and the prevention of attacks. By facilitating a reliable, scalable, and flexible design, the specific requirements of IDPS for SGs can be more easily met via a fuzzy risk analyzer, an independent and ontology knowledge-based inference engine module. These can work collaboratively by managing functions across multiple IDPS domains. A set of extensive and intensive simulated experiments shows that with its smart advanced components incorporating soft computing machine-learning techniques and a rich ontology knowledge base with fuzzy logic analysis, it detects and prevents intrusions more efficiently. The multi-faceted results of the simulation also show that the proposed Collaborative Smart IDPS (CSIDPS) system increases the intrusion detection accuracy and decreases the false positive alarms when compared to traditional IDPSs. This is epitomized by the skillful use of the confusion matrix technique for organizing classifiers, visualizing their performance, and assessing their overall behavior. In the final analysis, the CSIDPS architecture is designed toward contributing to de facto norms for SG ecosystems.},

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid method based on enhanced fuzzy multi-criteria collaborative filtering which incorporates demographic information and an item-based ontological semantic filtering approach for movie recommendation purposes. We use an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to discover the relationship between each criterion and the overall rating. A fusion of fuzzy cosine and Jaccard similarities is further adopted to calculate the total similarity between users/movies with respect to the effect of co-rated item set cardinality on the reliability of similarity measures. To increase the robustness and reliability of the final similarity measure, especially in the case of cold start users, a convex combination of both user and movie based similarities is used; in which the convex weightings are determined through the gradient decent algorithm to ensure a minimum prediction error. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in reducing the sparsity problem and improving the prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {In the traditional Web, users are considered as information consumers. In social Web, users play a much more active role since they are now not only information consumers but also data providers. Users like online posting reviews which has become an increasingly popular way to express opinions and sentiments toward the products bought or services received. Analyzing these reviews can be helpful for collecting opinions of people about products, social events and problems and would produce useful actionable knowledge that could be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. Thus, due to the huge number of reviews and their unstructured nature, efficient computational methods are needed for mining and summarizing these reviews, because regular analysis of reviews does not indicate user likes and dislikes. In a review, user typically writes about both the positive and negative aspects of the object, although the general sentiment toward that object may be positive or negative. That's why sentiment analysis together with opinion mining try to extract and study of user's opinions, sentiments and subjectivity of text. However, this analysis must come with careful consideration of user's anonymity and the privacy of their sensitive data as privacy is today an important concern for both users and enterprises. In this research, automatic analysis of opinions (opinion mining) is performed to obtain such detailed aspects based on ontology. Opinion mining identify the features in the opinion and classify the sentiments of the opinion for each of these features. Opinion mining is a difficult task, owing to both the high semantic variability of the opinions expressed, and the diversity of the characteristics and sub-characteristics that describe the products and the multitude of opinion words used to depict them. In the proposed approach, the opinion polarity and polarity strength are measured using fuzzy set. As the fuzzy set theory is quite effective in processing natural languages, to measure the vagueness, it will also be effective in analyzing review articles, which are generally in natural languages. Additionally, the proposed system takes privacy into consideration by anonymizing data before final publishing. Methods of generalization and micro-aggregation are utilized for anonymizing quasi-identifiers to maintain the balance between data utility and user privacy. {\textcopyright} 2005 – ongoing JATIT {\&} LLS.},

By far, Gene-centric or network-centric gene prioritization methods are predominated. Genes and their protein products carry out cellular processes in the context of functional modules. Dysfunctional gene modules have been previously reported to have associations with cancer. However, gene module information has seldom been considered in cancer-related gene prioritization. Results: In this study, we propose a novel method, MGOGP (Module and Gene Ontology-based Gene Prioritization), for cancer-related gene prioritization. Different from other methods, MGOGP ranks genes considering information of both individual genes and their affiliated modules, and utilize Gene Ontology (GO) based fuzzy measure value as well as known cancer-related genes as heuristics. The performance of the proposed method is comprehensively validated by using both breast cancer and prostate cancer datasets, and by comparison with other methods. Results show that MGOGP outperforms other methods, and successfully prioritizes more genes with literature confirmed evidence.

The first step in building CBR system is preparing a comprehensive case base from patients' electronic health records (EHRs). EHR data need quality improvement steps, such as normalization, feature selection, feature weighting, and outlier detection. In the medical field, the representation of resulting case base using formalized concepts and terminologies is highly needed. There are many structures for representing case bases, but the most powerful method for representation is using ontologies. The manuscript proposes a methodology for diagnosing the chronic kidney disease based on an ontology reasoning mechanism. In this paper, we first prepare the chronic kidney dataset of 400 real cases with 25 features by utilizing a set of data mining algorithms. Next, we construct an ontology structure to represent this case base in the W3C web ontology language (OWL) ontology format and populate this ontology with the individual cases. The fuzzy rough set algorithm achieved the highest accuracy for selecting the most suitable feature set. The resulting OWL ontology is based on disease ontology (DO) semantics, which is the most common and standardized ontology in the medical field. {\textcopyright} 2018 ACCENTS.},

abstract = {Web services are software entities that have a well defined interface and perform a specific task. A number of web services are composed together to fulfill the customer requirements because single web service not always fulfill the customer requirements. It can be grouped based on different similarity measures. The domain-ontology-based PSOinspired balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH) clustering and improved bipartite graph (IBG), determines the relevancy between web services based on concept distance similarity measure. Based on this similarity measure the web services are clustered and ranked. The major drawback of this method is, there is no single similarity measure is optimal for determining the relevancy between web services. So in this proposed work, an efficient clustering method is proposed that uses different matchers with different similarity measures to calculate the relevancy between web services. It enhances the improved bipartite graph based web service matching. But the different matcher may return different clustering results, so a majority voting algorithm called as Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm is introduced to finalize the clusters. After clustering the web services, the web services are ranked based on QoS based Fuzzy clustering. Experimental results show that the proposed method the efficiency of web service composition in terms of accuracy, runtime, recall and precision. {\textcopyright} 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract = {Detecting and classifying anomalies for Maritime Situation Awareness highly benefits from the combination of multiple sources, correlating their output for detecting inconsistencies in vessels' behaviour. Adequate uncertainty representation and processing are crucial for this higher-level task where the operator analyses information in conjunction with background knowledge and context. This paper addresses the problem of performance criteria identification and definition for information fusion systems in their ability to handle uncertainty. In addition to the classical algorithmic performances such as accuracy, computational cost or timeliness, other aspects such as the interpretation, simplicity or expressiveness need to be considered in the design of the technique for uncertainty management for an improved synergy between the human and the system. The Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Evaluation Framework (URREF) ontology aims at connecting these criteria to other uncertainty-related concepts. In this paper, we dissect six classical Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Techniques (URRTs) in their basic form framed into three uncertainty models of probability, belief functions and fuzzy sets, and addressing a fusion problem for maritime anomaly detection. We introduce the Uncertainty Supports as a means to capture what is the carrier of uncertainty and distinguish between three types of supports, that are single variables, sets of variables and uncertainty representations. The latter type indeed captures second-order uncertainty. The different URRTs are qualitatively evaluated according to their expressiveness along the uncertainty supports, and quantitatively evaluated according their accuracy and conclusiveness (uncertainty and imprecision) when processing real AIS data with pseudo-synthetic anomalies. This study illustrates a possible use of the URREF for the assessment and comparison of uncertainty handling methods in fusion systems. The framework provides solid basic foundations for a formal assessment to guide further development and implementation of fusion schemes, as well as for the definition of associated criteria and measures of performance. °c 2018 JAIF},

abstract = {Purpose: As the elder population grows, the need for domestic healthcare
is on the rise. Both robotics and smart environments, including smart
homes, provide a promising solution to monitor, interact and keep
company to users. However, in real case scenarios, sensors data are not
perfect and the environment changes over time, leading to erroneous
understanding of the context and inappropriate responses. The purpose of
this work is to tackle those challenges in order to improve the autonomy
and efficiency of robots in smart environments.
Methods: The problematic was structured into three steps: (1)
perception, (2) cognition and (3) action. We proposed and evaluated a
software framework that covers the challenges of each step. It includes
respectively: (1) a context acquisition method that supports and models
the uncertainty of data by using complex event processing, fuzzy logic
and ontologies; (2) an activity recognition system that combines vision,
context knowledge and semantic reasoning; (3) a dynamic hierarchical
task planner that alternates planning and execution. For each step, the
framework was evaluated through simulations and/or experiments using a
robot and a smart room.
Results: The quality of the perception was assessed by measuring the
efficiency of a cognition process using the acquired context knowledge.
An uncertain environment was simulated, and results show our framework
to enable a gain of 10{\%} of correctness for an activity recognition
process. The cognition part of the framework was evaluated by observing
several persons performing activities. It achieved an overall 90{\%}
correct recognition, yet, such result questions the relevance of our
approach. Finally, the action step was confronted a simulated scenario
with various levels of dynamism. Our task planner appeared to reduce, by
up to 23{\%}, the number of tasks required to reach a goal in a dynamic
environment.
Conclusion: Our framework provides software tools that make robots and
smart environments more relevant in real housings. By supporting the
uncertainty of context data and the dynamism of the environment, robots
and smart environments can achieve more effectively their purposes in
domestic healthcare applications. (C) 2018 AGBM. Published by Elsevier

abstract = {We propose a method to extract and integrate fuzzy information granules
from a populated OWL ontology. The purpose of this approach is to
represent imprecise knowledge within an OWL ontology, as motivated by
the fact that the Semantic Web is full of imprecise and uncertain
information coming from perceptual data, incomplete data, data with
errors, etc. In particular, we focus on Fuzzy Set Theory as a means for
representing and processing information granules corresponding to
imprecise concepts usually expressed by linguistic terms. The method
applies to numerical data properties. The values of a property are first
clustered to form a collection of fuzzy sets. Then, for each fuzzy set,
the relative sigma-count is computed and compared with a number of
predefined fuzzy quantifiers, which are therefore used to define new
assertions that are added to the original ontology. In this way, the
extended ontology provides both a punctual view and a granular view of
individuals w.r.t. the selected property. We use a real-world ontology
concerning hotels and populated with data of the Italian city of Pisa,
to illustrate the method and to test its implementation. We show that it
is possible to extract granular properties that can be described in
natural language and smoothly integrated in the original ontology by
means of annotated assertions.},

Most of the preceeding travel recommendation methodologies are capable of recommending a personalized travel by considering the POIs. The major objective of this paper is to design a new Multi-Ontology based Points of Interest (MO-POIs) travel recommendation system which considers the POIs of the user along with the individual semantic information. Initially stage, the personalized MO-POIs sequence is recommended, and the routes are ranked based on the individual depending on the package he uses. Both the user and route package similarities are evaluated using parallel fuzzy clustering algorithm in this research work. Map Reduce is used as a parallel computation model in this research which performs computation with the help of a couple of functions that are termed as map and reduce. The social users travel records are used to optimize the top ranked routes. Finally, the new MO-POIs recommendation system evaluation is finished with a billion of Flicker images, uploaded by thousands of users and also more than 24,000 travelogues that cover the estimated 850 and above travel POIs in nine renowned cities, and illustrates its efficiency. The results are measured using the performance metrics like average precision and weighted average precision. The evaluation concludes that the proposed algorithm is capable of performing well in recent works that uses travel logs. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

However, recent studies have heightened the need for more efficient approaches for extracting a reduced count of distinct fuzzy concepts in a reasonable time. This paper aims mainly to address such challenge. Generally, the proposed approach is composed of two main stages to handle quantitative data effectively. Firstly, a data-sensitive fuzzification stage maps the many-valued context to a more consistent fuzzy one. Secondly, an enhanced algorithm generates a reduced count of valuable fuzzy concepts and merges the more similar ones. Accordingly, the proposed approach can efficiently handle very large datasets where the process of extracting all fuzzy concepts is an intractable task. Surprisingly, the proposed approach reduces the overall processing time and complexity when compared with some other previous approaches. {\textcopyright} 2018 International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.},

abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic and dangerous neurological disorder affecting
millions of people worldwide. Considering the critical level that this
patient's condition can reach, the continuous surveillance by the side
of the patient, the people of his/her context and his/her physician is
necessary as the seizure must be treated quickly. However, the symptoms
that lead to these seizures are quite fuzzy and they can go undetected
even by the patient. For this reason, this paper proposes a Transition
Model between the different phases of epilepsy in order to be adopted by
decision-making systems used by people who are diagnosed with the
specific disorder. The goal of this model is to be able to monitor the
patient and detect abnormalities providing a time margin for him/her to
take actions and for his/her caregivers to be prepared to help and act.
Based on the whole model's transitions information, epilepsy is
represented by a health caring ontology which contains all the useful
aspects of it. Finally, we used a programming language, Java, for the
implementation of a decision-making telemonitoring algorithm that
intergrates the proposed ontology.},

abstract = {Aiming at providing an effective mechanism for representation,
organization, and reuse of fixture design knowledge, this paper puts
forward an intelligent methodology for fixture design based on knowledge
component technology. First, the ontology models of fixture elements,
the workpiece, and the fixture design case are constructed to organize
the statical design knowledge related to each of them. Then, the fixture
design process-related knowledge is modeled by knowledge components
corresponding to fixture layout planning process and fixture structure
design process. Hence, the hierarchy structure of the fixture design
knowledge reuse is formed. Under the framework of the fixture layout
knowledge component, the association analysis method is used for
generating reasoning rules and then the rule-based reasoning (RBR)
method is used for the determination of the workpiece-locating mode and
the initiative candidate of the locating datum. Further, an entropy
weight fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is employed to select the
most suitable locating datum from the candidates. Under the framework of
the fixture structure design knowledge component, the selection of
fixture elements, element dimension drive, and auto-assemble are
fulfilled by the combination of RBR and case-based reasoning (CBR). The
method realizes the effective organization and efficient use of fixture
design knowledge and improves the efficiency of fixture design. It has
been verified by a case of airplane part machining fixture design.},

the constructors of both fuzzy SHOIN(D) DL and fuzzy OWL ontology and
add some common fuzzy datatypes (e.g., trapezoidal values, interval
values, approximate values, and labels) into the knowledge bases. On
this basis, we propose an approach which can store fuzzy DL-knowledge

explain the approach. The correctness and quality of the storage

study aimed to present a framework in which, first, a new ontology-based
water quality index (WQI) was developed by multi-criteria
decision-making models in fuzzy environment and then, it was coupled
with geographic information system (GIS) in order to model the temporal
and spatial water quality changes in groundwater resources that are
being supplied for drinking. The study screened for heavy metals in 45
wells in the west and northwest side of Shiraz, Iran from for a 5-year
period. Six heavy metals including Pb, Zn, Hg, Cd, As, and Cr were
embedded in the WQI among which the annual mean concentrations of Pb,
Zn, Cd, Cr, and As increased during the research period but remained
below World Health Organization (WHO) standard values in all years but,
only the mean concentration of mercury exceeded the recommended WHO
standard values. The methodology clearly discovered that over the time,
water quality degradation has been moved from the northern part to the
middle and then the southern part of Shiraz because of significant
increase in heavy metals concentration which was due to the industrial
development in the eastern part of the city. Groundwater quality
declined over the time leading to a gradual increase in number of wells
with poor water quality; however, most of them demonstrated excellent or
good quality for drinking purpose. The presented framework could provide
a practical pathway to portray and predict how urban development will
affect the groundwater quality in future and find out its pattern.},

abstract = {In service to the state of the art, advances are required toward
redesigning the framework over which web applications are built. The
semantic web lies at the intersection of web and machine understandable
meaningful data, turning it into intelligent `web of data'. The key
requirement with any intelligent system has been to find a concrete
knowledge representation that can make the inferences within time and
space constraints; that is, reasoning effectively and efficiently within
the resource constraints posed to the problem at one hand and with
insufficient data as well as incomplete knowledge on the other hand.
Various Knowledge representation schemes have been proposed in the
literature, each having its limitation over the others. Ontology is the
key component for semantic web engineering. Ontologies are conceptual
knowledge bases providing a systematic and taxonomical description of
the concepts and instances under consideration. Conceptual clarity in
the computational representation of a concept is vital for holistic
thinking and knowledge engineering. In order to meet the needs of an
application/enterprise, knowledge should be presented taking care of all
possible perspectives; and represented in a hierarchical structure with
differing levels of granularity. This paper discusses about bringing all
the manifestations of an ontological concept/decision under one
umbrella; hence describing the resultant scheme as a unit of knowledge.
By representing a concept as a knowledge unit, classical ontology is
claimed to be sufficient in dealing with imprecise, vague and
heterogeneous knowledge for real-world web applications; and portrays
the capability to acquire fresh knowledge through its thorough
interaction with the external world in a given working environment.},

However, these stereotypes cannot accurately reflect the user's evaluation if they are based on limited historical data about other entities. In view of this issue, we propose a novel generalized stereotype learning approach: the fuzzy semantic framework. Specifically, we propose a fuzzy semantic process, incorporated with traditional machine-learning techniques to construct stereotypes. It consists of two sub-processes: a fuzzy process that generalizes over non-nominal attributes (e.g., price) by splitting their values in a fuzzy manner, and a semantic process that generalizes over nominal attributes (e.g., location) by replacing their specific values with more general terms according to a predefined ontology. We also implement the proposed framework on the traditional decision tree method to learn users' stereotypes and validate the effectiveness of our framework for computing trust in e-marketplaces. Experiments on real data confirm that our proposed model can accurately measure the trustworthiness of sellers with which buyers have limited experience.},

Proper Health-Care Waste Management (HCWM) and integrated documentation in this sector of hospitals require analyzing massive data collected by hospital's health experts. This study presented a quantitative software-based index to assess the HCWM process performance by integrating ontology-based Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making techniques and fuzzy modeling that were coupled with data mining. This framework represented the Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Corporate Performance Management (CPM) types of Process Mining in which a user-friendly software namely Group Fuzzy Decision-Making (GFDM) was employed for index calculation.
Findings
Assessing the governmental hospitals of Shiraz, Iran in 2016 showed that the proposed index was able to determine the waste management condition and clarify the blind spots of HCWM in the hospitals. The index values under 50 were found in some of the hospitals showing poor process performance that should be at the priority of optimization and improvement.
Conclusion
The proposed framework has distinctive features such as modeling the uncertainties (risks) in hospitals' process assessment and flexibility enabling users to define the intended criteria, stakeholders, and number of hospitals. Having computer-aided approach for decision process also accelerates the index calculation as well as its accuracy which would contribute to more willingness of hospitals' experts and other end-users to use the index in practice. The methodology could efficiently be employed as a tool for managing hospitals' event logs and digital documentation in big data environment not only for the health-care waste management, but also in other administrative wards of hospitals.},

Specifically, they could be used in an academic environment with the aim of improving the educational processes, not replacing, but complementing the most traditional face-to-face models. But nowadays the increasingly widespread use of new technologies and social networks is causing the information we have available to grow disproportionately, making it more difficult and expensive to access information of interest. To alleviate this problem, automatic tools such as recommender systems, could be used to facilitate the accesses to relevant information, that in an academic environment would help to customize the educational processes. So, in this paper we present SharingNotes, an academic social network that can generate personalized recommendations to improve teaching and learning processes. To achieve this goal, it incorporates a hybrid recommender system that uses an ontology to characterize the degrees of trust among network users, and adopts the fuzzy linguistic modeling to improve the representation of information. Then, the use of this platform allows adapting the educational process to the circumstances of each student. The evaluation developed demonstrates the usefulness of this educational social network, as well as the users' satisfaction while interacting and working with it.},

abstract = {The number of people with a chronic disease is rapidly increasing, giving the healthcare industry more challenging problems. To date, there exist several ontology and IoT-based healthcare systems to intelligently supervise the chronic patients for long-term care. The central purposes of these systems are to reduce the volume of manual work in recommendation systems. However, due to the increase of risk and uncertain factors of the diabetes patients, these healthcare systems cannot be utilized to extract precise physiological information about patient. Further, the existing ontology-based approaches cannot extract optimal membership value of risk factors; thus, it provides poor results. In this regards, this paper presents a type-2 fuzzy ontology–aided recommendation systems for IoT-based healthcare to efficiently monitor the patient's body while recommending diets with specific foods and drugs. The proposed system extracts the values of patient risk factors, determines the patient's health condition via wearable sensors, and then recommends diabetes-specific prescriptions for a smart medicine box and food for a smart refrigerator. The combination of type-2 Fuzzy Logic (T2FL) and the fuzzy ontology significantly increases the prediction accuracy of a patient's condition and the precision rate for drug and food recommendations. Information about the patient's disease history, foods consumed, and drugs prescribed is designed in the ontology to deliver decision-making knowledge using Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} Web Ontology Language (OWL)-2 tools. Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules and fuzzy logic are employed to automate the recommendation process. Moreover, Description Logic (DL) and Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries are used to evaluate the ontology.

abstract = {The smart product represents a new type of products, which contains
software and hardware components. Many obsolete smart products are
required to be recycled each year. In the developing countries, the
inappropriate treatment of obsolete smart products contaminates the
natural environment. This study aims to coordinate the abilities of
social recycling organisations and improve the recovery rate of waste
smart products. A framework of the recycling service for smart products
is proposed based on the concept of cloud manufacturing. In the
framework, a smart product ontology is designed to integrate the
lifecycle data generated by the smart product. To decide the recycling
choice of the components of smart products with the lifecycle data, a
fuzzy-rule-based decision method is proposed. In cloud-based recycling
service, the abilities of different recycling factories are virtualised
as a pool of recycling resources. The virtualisation is achieved by the
recycling resource ontology. In order to select optimal recycling
resources and encapsulate the recycling service, a
grey-relational-analysis-based method is proposed. A robot vacuum
cleaner, which is a smart product, is adopted to demonstrate the
proposed decision methods. The results show that the methods are
effective for deciding the cloud-based recycling service for smart
products.},

abstract = {In public vehicles, one of the major concerns is driver's level of expertise for its direct proportionality to safety of passengers. Hence, before a driver is subjected to certain type of vehicle, he should be thoroughly evaluated and categorized with respect to certain parameters instead of only one-time metric of having driving license. These aspects may be driver's expertise, vigilance, aptitude, experience years, cognition, driving style, formal education, terrain, region, minor violations, major accidents, and age group. The purpose of this categorization is to ascertain suitability of a driver for certain vehicle type(s) to ensure passengers' safety. Currently, no driver categorization technique fully comprehends the implicit as well as explicit characteristics of drivers dynamically. In this paper, machine learning–based dynamic and adaptive technique named D-CHAITs (driver categorization through hybrid of artificial intelligence techniques) is proposed for driver categorization with an objective focus on driver's attributes modeled in DriverOntology. A supervised mode of learning has been employed on a labeled dataset, having diverse profiles of drivers with attributes pertinent to drivers' perspectives of demographics, behaviors, expertise, and inclinations. A comparative analysis of D-CHAIT with three other machine learning techniques (fuzzy logic, case-based reasoning, and artificial neural networks) is also presented. The efficacy of all techniques was empirically measured while categorizing the drivers based on their profiles through metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure performance, and associated costs. These empirical quantifications assert D-CHAIT as a better technique than contemporary ones. The novelty of proposed technique is signified through preprocessing of feature attributes, quality of data, training of machine learning model on more relevant data, and adaptivity. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In the context of lifelong learning, learner profile has emerged as a feasible model that support and promote the provision of lifelong learning opportunities. Learner profile describes the attributes and outcomes of education in a learning system. It includes information on learner's gender, skills, education, interest, learning preferences, learning style, etc. This paper proposes an approach to construct a fuzzy based semantic learner profile in the promising technology of semantic web by using the concept of ontology and use it for the reasoning of learner preferences. The approach starts with the collection of learner's static and dynamic data. The dynamic data of learner particularly learner interest and learning style are extracted by weblog analysis and using algorithms such as semantic based representation using WordNet and modified decision tree classifier with strong rules based on Felder-Silverman learning style model. The retrieved data is then used to construct learner profile using ontology in which automatic learner profile updating is obtained using ontology based semantic similarity algorithm. Finally to achieve semantic retrieval from learner profile ontology, fuzzy concepts such as fuzzy linguistic variable and fuzzy IF THEN rules are applied. Fuzzy linguistic variable facilitate semantic retrieval and more specific classification from learner profile ontology and fuzzy IF THEN rules predict the learning preference of new students based on the forward chaining reasoning process implemented in the existing ontology model. The final representation of semantic fuzzy ontology based learner profile improves the performance of tasks such as classification, semantic retrieval and prediction of learning preference to the new learners. The case study is conducted for the real-time learners involved in studying the courses registered in Moodle Learning Management System. The experiments were performed with NetBeans IDE, Jena framework and Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} 4.2 beta editor. The experiments confirm that the proposed learner profile is a good representation of the learner's preferences. {\textcopyright} BEIESP.},

This step is critical because the results' quality of a Domain Specific Information Retrieval (IR) such as Hadith Information Retrieval is fundamentally dependent of the ranking function. A Hierarchical Fuzzy Logic Controller of Mamdani-type Fuzzy Inference System has been built to define the ranking function, based on the Malay Information retrieval's BM25 Model. The model examines three-inputs (Ontology BM25 Score, Fabrication Rate of Hadith and Shia Rate of Hadith) and four-output values of Final Ranking Score which consist of three triangular membership functions. The proposed system has outperformed the BM25 original score and the Vector Space Model (VM) on 16 queries, while the BM25 original score and Vector Space Model only yield better result in 9 and 2 queries respectively on the P@10, {\%}no measures and MAP. P@10 represent the values of Precision at Rank 10 P@10), {\%}no measures represent the percentage of queries with no relevant documents in the top ten retrieved and MAP represents Mean Average Precision of the queries. The results show the proposed system have capability to demote negative documents and move up the relevant documents in the ranking list and its capability to recall unseen document with the application of ontology in text retrieval.

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to introduce a hierarchical fuzzy system for an online review analysis named FLORA. FLORA enables tourists to decide their destination without reading numerous reviews from experienced tourists. It summarizes reviews and visualizes them through a hierarchical structure. The visualization does not only present overall quality of an accommodation, but it also presents the condition of the bed, hospitality of the front desk receptionist and much more in a snap. Design/methodology/approach: FLORA is a complete system which acquires online reviews, analyzes sentiments, computes feature scores and summarizes results in a hierarchical view. FLORA is designed to use an overall score, rated by real tourists as a baseline for accuracy comparison. The accuracy of FLORA has achieved by a novel sentiment analysis process (as part of a knowledge acquisition engine) based on semantic analysis and a novel rating technique, called hierarchical fuzzy calculation, in the knowledge inference engine. Findings: The performance comparison of FLORA against related work has been assessed in two aspects. The first aspect focuses on review analysis with binary format representation. The results reveal that the hierarchical fuzzy method, with probability weighting of FLORA, is achieved with the highest values in precision, recall and F-measure. The second aspect looks at review analysis with a five-point rating scale rating by comparing with one of the most advanced research methods, called fuzzy domain ontology. The results reveal that the hierarchical fuzzy method, with probability weighting of FLORA, returns the closest results to the tourist-defined rating. Research limitations/implications: This research advances knowledge of online review analysis by contributing a novel sentiment analysis process and a novel rating technique. The FLORA system has two limitations. First, the reviews are based on individual expression, which is an arbitrary distinction and not always grammatically correct. Consequently, some opinions may not be extracted because the context free grammar rules are insufficient. Second, natural languages evolve and diversify all the time. Many emerging words or phrases, including idioms, proverbs and slang, are often used in online reviews. Thus, those words or phrases need to be manually updated in the knowledge base. Practical implications: This research contributes to the tourism business and assists travelers by introducing comprehensive and easy to understand information about each accommodation to travelers. Although the FLORA system was originally designed and tested with accommodation reviews, it can also be used with reviews of any products or services by updating data in the knowledge base. Thus, businesses, which have online reviews for their products or services, can benefit from the FLORA system. Originality/value: This research proposes a FLORA system which analyzes sentiments from online reviews, computes feature scores and summarizes results in a hierarchical view. Moreover, this work is able to use the overall score, rated by real tourists, as a baseline for accuracy comparison. The main theoretical implication is a novel sentiment analysis process based on semantic analysis and a novel rating technique called hierarchical fuzzy calculation. {\textcopyright} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Social media has taken an important place in the routine life of people. Every single second, users from all over the world are sharing interests, emotions, and other useful information that leads to the generation of huge volumes of user-generated data. Profiling users by extracting attribute information from social media data has been gaining importance with the increasing user-generated content over social media platforms. Meeting the user's satisfaction level for information collection is becoming more challenging and difficult. This is because of too much noise generated, which affects the process of information collection due to explosively increasing online data. Social profiling is an emerging approach to overcome the challenges faced in meeting user's demands by introducing the concept of personalized search while keeping in consideration user profiles generated using social network data. This study reviews and classifies research inferring users social profile attributes from social media data as individual and group profiling. The existing techniques along with utilized data sources, the limitations, and challenges are highlighted. The prominent approaches adopted include Machine Learning, Ontology, and Fuzzy logic. Social media data from Twitter and Facebook have been used by most of the studies to infer the social attributes of users. The studies show that user social attributes, including age, gender, home location, wellness, emotion, opinion, relation, influence, and so on, still need to be explored. This review gives researchers insights of the current state of literature and challenges for inferring user profile attributes using social media data. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.},

abstract = {Automated Web service composition remains always one of the most challenging research area due to the continuously growing number of semantic Web services. Several formalization and composition approaches were proposed, but they are not mature and flexible. They assume that each sub-task is an atomic process, hence it cannot be decomposed based on user requirements. Moreover, these techniques and formalizations are not suitable for dynamic environments, does not consider incomplete and ambiguous query for which knowledge might be of great use. The aim of this work is to propose a novel horizontal and vertical composition of Web services based on Fuzzy Constraint Satisfaction Problem (FCSP) with knowledge integration. Knowledge, can be extracted from several sources, i.e. a datawarehouse of abstract workflows containing the best compositional practices in a given domain, ontologies, Web mining, etc. The proposed approach was implemented and applied to randomly generated examples using parameters reflecting the real world. Experimental results showed that the integration of knowledge with the CSP formalization gives remarkably better results in terms of the percentage of solved problems. {\textcopyright} 2019 [International Journal of Artificial Intelligence].},

abstract = {Formal concept analysis is the process of data analysis mechanism with emergent attractiveness across various fields such as data mining, robotics, medical, big data and so on. FCA is helpful to generate the new learning ontology based techniques. In medical field, some growing kids are facing the problem of representing their knowledge from their gathered prior data which is in the form of unordered and insufficient clustered data which is not supporting them to take the right decision on right time for solving the uncertainty based questionnaires. In the approach of decision theory, many mathematical replicas such as probability-allocation, crisp set, and fuzzy based set theory were designed to deals with knowledge representation based difficulties along with their characteristic. This paper is proposing new ideological blended approach of FCA with FLC and described with major objectives: primarily the FCA analyzes the data based on relationships between the set of objects of prior-attributes and the set of attributes based prior-data, which the data is framed with data-units implicated composition which are formal statements of idea of human thinking with conversion of significant intelligible explanation. Suitable rules are generated to explore the relationship among the attributes and used the formal concept analysis from these suitable rules to explore better knowledge and most important factors affecting the decision making. Secondly how the FLC derive the fuzzification, rule-construction and defuzzification methods implicated for representing the accurate knowledge for uncertainty based questionnaires. Here the FCA is projected to expand the FCA based conception with help of the objective based item set notions considered as the target which is implicated with the expanded cardinalities along with its weights which is associated through the fuzzy based inference decision rules. This approach is more helpful for medical experts for knowing the range of patient's memory deficiency also for people whose are facing knowledge explorer deficiency.

Thus, an ontology was designed and implemented to formalize the implicit

final ontology was delivered after three design phases: specification,
conceptualization, and knowledge formalization. Imagery preprocessing
through anisotropic morphological levelings reduced undesired spatial
detail and noise. A three-level segmentation and ontological
classification approach was developed to compute proper objects and
assign them into semantic categories. Class definitions were created
through fuzzy restrictions, representing value ranges of the employed
properties. Evaluation of the extracted foreshore area with

system to gather and interpret traffic information. In addition,
mobility users utilize mobile applications to collect transport

not sufficient to examine all aspects of the transportation networks.
Therefore, both ITSs and mobility users need a smart approach and social

People utilize social networks to share their thoughts and opinions
regarding transportation, which are useful for ITSs and travelers.
However, user-generated text on social media is short in length,
unstructured, and covers a broad range of dynamic topics. The
application of recent Machine Learning (ML) approach is inefficient for
extracting relevant features from unstructured data, detecting word
polarity of features, and classifying the sentiment of features
correctly. In addition, ML classifiers consistently miss the semantic
feature of the word meaning. A novel fuzzy ontology-based semantic

illustrate a feature-based and context-sensitive sentiment analysis

knowledge representation using ontology can provide effective semantic
retrieval facility which is more efficient than representation using
semantic networks and frames. The existing information retrieval systems
have been developed to handle very large volume of data and information
stored in text format. On the other hand, the information available in
the current web based applications such as Facebook and twitter grow
very fast and hence the existing information retrieval systems consume
large amount of time for relevant information retrieval. Moreover, most
of the existing search engines use syntactic approach for information
retrieval and use page ranking algorithms to measure the relevancy
score. However, such approach is not able to provide more accurate
results in terms of relevancy. Therefore, a new semantic information
retrieval system is proposed in this paper which uses feature selection
and classification for enhancing the relevancy score which is performed
in this work by proposing a new intelligent fuzzy rough set based
feature selection algorithm and an intelligent ontology and Latent
Dirichlet Allocation based semantic information retrieval algorithm. The
main advantages of the proposed algorithms are the increase in

associated with the images. Uncertain frequent pattern mining is then
applied on the association that exists among the concepts in images.
These patterns assist in retrieving images, which contain the required
query keywords in high proportion than other keywords. The ranking of
retrieved images is evaluated with two different measures, i.e., mean

according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the

In this paper, we propose an efficient social-like semantic-aware service discovery mechanism named SLSA by mimicking human-like social behaviors and exploring cooperative intelligence. Our mechanism can discover desired services in a fast and scalable manner. The update process of knowledge index adopts a dual-modular-ordering stack strategy that makes search more efficient. Considering the semantic similarity and semantic relativity of two concepts in the domain ontology, we introduce the fuzzy logic method to calculate their correlation degree for device ranking. The SLSA implements an adaptive forwarding strategy, where the service query is forwarded to a selected subset of neighboring devices in a preferred order. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate four mechanisms by establishing dynamic environments. The simulation results show that the SLSA achieves better performance than the other relevant mechanisms with three aspects.

Context information plays a crucial role in such dynamically changing environments and the different types of contextual conditions bring new challenges to context-sensitive access control. This information mostly can be derived from the crisp sets. For example, we can utilize a crisp set to derive a patient and nurse are co-located in the general ward of the hospital or not. Some of the context information characterizations cannot be made using crisp sets, however, they are equally important in order to make access control decisions. Towards this end, this article proposes an approach to Context-Aware Access Control using Fuzzy logic (FCAAC) for data and information resources. We introduce a formal context model to represent the fuzzy and other contextual conditions. We also introduce a formal policy model to specify the policies by utilizing these conditions. Using our formal approach, we combine the fuzzy model with an ontology-based approach that captures such contextual conditions and incorporates them into the policies, utilizing the ontology languages and the fuzzy logic-based reasoning. We introduce a unified data ontology and its associated mapping ontology in terms of facilitating access control to cloud-based data resources. We justify the feasibility of our approach by demonstrating the practicality through a prototype implementation, several healthcare case studies and a usability study. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental evaluation in terms of query response time. The experiment results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of our proposed FCAAC approach.},

abstract = {Temporal representation and reasoning are important facets in the design of many Semantic Web applications. Several approaches exist to represent and reason about precise temporal data in ontology. However, most of them handle only time intervals and associated qualitative relations. Besides, to the best of our knowledge, there is no approach devoted to handle imprecise temporal data (e.g., “late 1970s”). In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for representing and reasoning about precise and imprecise temporal data. Quantitative temporal data (i.e., time intervals and points) and qualitative ones (i.e., relations between time intervals, relations between a time interval and a time point and relations between time points) are taken into consideration. Our approach is three folds: (i) extending the 4D-fluents approach with new crisp and fuzzy components, to represent precise and imprecise temporal data, (ii) extending the Allen's interval algebra to enable reasoning about precise and imprecise temporal data, and (iii) creating a Fuzzy-OWL 2 ontology TimeOnto that, based on the extended Allen's interval algebra, instantiates our 4D-fluents-based representation. The extension that we propose for the Allen's interval algebra handles precise and imprecise time intervals. Indeed, it enables expressing precise (e.g., “before”) and imprecise (e.g., “just before”) temporal relations. Compared to related work, our imprecise relations are personalized, in the sense that they are not limited to a defined set of interval relations and their meanings are determined by the domain expert. For instance, the classic Allen's relation “Before” may be generalized in 5 imprecise relations, where “Before(1)” means “just before” and gradually the time gap between the two intervals increases until “Before(5)” which means “very long before”. To enable this representation, we propose an extension of the Vilain and Kautz's point algebra and redefined the Allen's relations by means of this extended algebra. We show in this paper that, unlike most related work, the resulting relations preserve many of the desirable properties of the Allen's interval algebra. The definitions of the resulting interval relations are adapted to allow relating a time interval and a time point, and two time points, where time intervals and points maybe both precise or both imprecise. These relations can be used for temporal reasoning by means of four transitivity tables. Finally, we describe a prototype based on “TimeOnto” that infers new relations using a set of SWRL and fuzzy IF-THEN rules. This prototype was integrated in an ontology-based memory prosthesis for Alzheimer's patients.},

abstract = {Pervasive computing has been a buzzing phrase these days as many areas accelerate their pace in developing pervasive computing systems. A pervasive computing aims at incorporating the computing technologies in a graceful and transparent manner, and make computing solutions available anywhere and at any time. Different aspects of pervasive computing, like smart homes, smart offices, social networks, micromarketing applications, PDAs, etc. are becoming a part of everyday life. However, ensuring privacy in pervasive computing has been a significant challenge that needs to be addressed for efficient adaptation of pervasive computing. In education domain, providing authentication for users poses difficulties in determining trustworthiness. In order to overcome the aforementioned challenges, a novel trust-based privacy preservation framework via ontology service ranking (TBPF-OSR) for user authentication is proposed in this work. At first, registration process is performed where a designated role manager assigns specific roles for all users based on their accessibility. Also, a new user generation methodology is allotted via generating user registration form. Further, authentication process is performed where the user request are validated based on the assigned roles. Finally, service handling is performed to effectively handle the requests generated in order to ensure service robustness and access control. Additionally, ontology based service ranking is performed via fuzzy logic based service recommendation algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Ontologies are not only crucial for extending the traditional web into
the Semantic Web but also for developing intelligent applications, by
converting the raw data into smart data, through semantic enrichment.
However, crisp Ontologies are not able to represent fuzzy knowledge
which is often encountered in real-world applications. Fuzzy Ontology
introduces fuzzy logical rules in Ontology for representing imprecise
domain concepts such as darkness, hotness, thickness, creamy etc. in a
machine-readable and interoperable format. The performance of fuzzy
Ontology decreases with the increase of fuzziness in the domain
knowledge. Type-2 fuzzy Ontologies (T2FO) were introduced to represent
the domain knowledge where the concepts are either extremely vague or
their vagueness increases gradually. The type-2 fuzzy Ontology domain is
continuously expanding and there is a need to provide a comprehensive
review incorporating the literature of T2FO development approaches, its
applications in different domains, reasoners developed for inferencing
on type-2 fuzzy Ontology, and evaluation approaches. To perform a
comprehensive survey about the T2FO, we used Google Scholar as the main
literature research tool to review papers published between 1998 to
2018. We then summarized the published approaches by comparing their
features proposed for T2FO development, reasoning or inference, and
evaluation approaches. This paper also identifies the domains wherein
the past T2FO has been used to develop real-world applications. We
conclude this paper by summarizing the previous work, and by identifying
the research gaps for investigators.},

However, ordinary assessments do not help leaders analyze their knowledge and wisdom behind their behaviours.

By utilising the dimensions and planes of the Wisdom Cube, we can find the way from data handling, information processing, and knowledge creation to wisdom generation.

Recent studies suggest the involvement of multiple microRNAs in the tumorigenesis of various leukemias. However, until now, no comprehensive database exists for miRNAs and their cognate target genes involved specifically in ALL. Therefore, we developed 'LeukmiR' a dynamic database comprising in silico predicted microRNAs, and experimentally validated miRNAs along with the target genes they regulate in mouse and human. LeukmiR is a user-friendly platform with search strings for ALL-associated microRNAs, their sequences, description of target genes, their location on the chromosomes and the corresponding deregulated signaling pathways. For the user query, different search modules exist where either quick search can be carried out using any fuzzy term or by providing exact terms in specific modules. All entries for both human and mouse genomes can be retrieved through multiple options such as miRNA ID, their accession number, sequence, target genes, Ensemble-ID or Entrez-ID. User can also access miRNA: mRNA interaction networks in different signaling pathways, the genomic location of the targeted regions such as 3'UTR, 5'UTR and exons with their gene ontology and disease ontology information in both human and mouse systems. Herein, we also report 51 novel microRNAs which are not described earlier for ALL. Thus, LeukmiR database will be a valuable source of information for researchers to understand and investigate miRNAs and their targets with diagnostic and therapeutic potential in ALL.

abstract = {Integrating sustainability into freight transportation systems (FTSs) is a complex and challenging task due to the sheer number of inherent sustainability risks. Sustainability risks disrupt the economic, social and environmental objectives of freight operations and act as impediments in the development of sustainable freight transportation systems. The area of sustainability risk management is still unexplored and immature in the operational research domain. This study addresses these research gaps and contributes in a threefold manner. First, a total of 36 potential sustainability risks related to FTSs are identified and uniquely classified into seven categories using a rigourous approach. Second, the research proposes two prominent perspectives, namely, ontological and epistemological perspectives to understand risks and develops a novel framework for managing sustainability risks in FTSs. Third, a novel approach by integrating fuzzy evidential reasoning algorithm (FERA) with expected utility theory is developed to quantitatively model and profile sustainability risk for different risk preferences, namely, risk-averse, risk-neutral, and risk-taking scenarios. The proposed FERA is a flexible and robust approach, which transforms the experts' inputs into belief structures and aggregates them using the evidence combination rule proposed in Dempster–Shafer theory to overcome the problem of imprecise results caused by average scoring in existing models. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model. Unlike conventional perception, our study suggests that most of the high priority sustainability risks are behaviorally and socially induced rather than financially driven. The results provide significant managerial implications including a focus on skills development, and on social and behavioral dimensions while managing risks in FTSs. {\textcopyright} 2019 Society for Risk Analysis},

abstract = {Specifying assembly tasks in computer-aided design (CAD) level is a promising approach to intuitively program complex robot skills. In this article, a three-layered system architecture is presented to generate sensor-based robot skills from an assembly task instance. The architecture consists of an application layer where the user instantiates assembly tasks by specifying CAD constraints between geometric primitives pairs. A process layer infers the most suitable robot skills and their appropriate parameters. This inference is made possible by reasoning on a knowledge database represented as an ontology. The ontology contains semantic models of relevant classes such as tasks, skills, and geometric primitives as well as the relations between them. A control layer executes the sensor-based skills in real time using the eTaSL programming framework. A software implementation for the three layers is presented. The application layer is implemented in FreeCAD, whereas the process layer consists of a Web ontology language (OWL) ontology, a Prolog-based reasoner, and fuzzy inference to correctly select the skill and generate its parameters. In the control layer, the instantiated eTaSL skills execute the assembly tasks by sending an optimized control command to the robot. The system is validated on two challenging assembly cases with two distinct robot types, thus demonstrating the system's capability across different scenarios. Note to Practitioners-The widespread use of computer-aided design (CAD) models for describing parts assembly has motivated the research community to create systems that automatically generate robot programs satisfying the assembly goal. While most of the existing literature focuses on generating the assembly sequence, this article deals with the aspect of translation from CAD-level assembly specification to executable robot motion, also called skills. This article systematically addresses the problem by dividing it into different layers and solving them separately. Parameters that influence the successful execution of an assembly task are identified and categorized into application-and process-related parameters. Different inference techniques are employed to address each parameter category. Experimental results show that the proposed system can successfully generate and execute robot skills for assembly scenarios of an air compressor and an electric motor. {\textcopyright} 2004-2012 IEEE.},

In the user interface layer, any linguistic or semantic queries can be done by dealing with only the global reference fuzzy ontology.

abstract = {Over the past two decades, the large evolution of software engineering, telecommunication and pervasive devices has lead to emergence of a new vision of development aiming at building systems to meet more complex and personalised needs known as context-aware systems. This type of systems is becoming the next computing paradigm in which infrastructure and services are sensitive to any change of the context, so that plays a crucial role to provide interactive intelligent environments. In parallel, contextual situation refers to a higher level of information inferred from different context data flow that can be extracted from physical and virtual sensors. The power of using situation is lies in their ability to provide a simple and comprehensible representation of context property, which preserve the services that manipulate them from the complexity of sensor readings, data transmission errors and inferencing activities. In this work, we aim to explore the added value of using ontology-based reasoning, focusing on first-order logic and fuzzy logic, to produce contextual situations.

The software security management system has received considerable attention lately and various efforts have been made in this direction. However, security is usually only considered in the early stages of the development of software. Thus, this leads to stating other vulnerabilities from a security perspective. Moreover, despite the abundance of security knowledge available online and in books, the systems that are being developed are seldom sufficiently secure. In this paper, we have highlighted the need for including application context sensitive modeling within a case-based software security management system. Furthermore, we have taken the context-driven and ontology-based frameworks and prioritized their attributes according to their weights which were achieved by using the Fuzzy AHP methodology.

abstract = {Assistive health care system is a viable solution for elderly care to
offer independent living. Such health care systems are feasible through
smart homes, which are intended to enhance the living quality of the
occupant. Activities of daily living (ADL) are considered in the design
of a smart home and are extended to abnormality detection in the case of
health care. Abnormality in occupant behavior is the deviation of
ongoing activity with that of the built activity model. Generally,
supervised machine learning strategies or knowledge engineering
strategies are employed in the process of activity modeling. Supervised
machine learning approaches incur overheads in annotating the dataset,
while the knowledge modeling approaches incur overhead by being
dependent on the domain expert for occupant specific knowledge. The
proposed approach on the other hand, employs an unsupervised machine
learning strategy to readily extract knowledge from unlabelled data
using contextual pattern clustering and subsequently represents it as
ontology activity model. Ontology offers enhanced activity recognition
through its semantically clear representation and reasoning, it has
restriction in handling temporal data. Hence, this article in addition
to unsupervised modeling focuses at enabling temporal reasoning within
ontology using fuzzy logic. The proposed fuzzy ontology activity
recognition (FOAR) framework represents an activity model as a fuzzy
temporal ontology. Fuzzy SWRL rules modeled within ontology aid activity
recognition and abnormality detection for health care. The experimental
results show that the proposed FOAR has better performance in

However, Fuzzy ontology, an extension of the crisp ontology that

abstract = {Design for Remanufacturing (DfRem) plays an important role in
remanufacturing, which promotes the product remanufacturability, and
enhance the efficiency of remanufacturing processes. However, due to the
large and fuzzy demand data, it is difficult to accurately extract DfRem
targets from the customer demand data. Moreover, the process of DfRem
scheme generation includes conceptual design, general design and
detailed design. The remanufacturability of products needs be considered
at the design process, which makes the DfRem scheme solution process
very complicated. For the purpose of accurately extracting DfRem targets
and shortening design cycle, it is necessary to apply intelligent
technology for customer demand analysis and DfRem solution. To address
this, an intelligent DfRem method based on vector space model (VSM) and
case-based reasoning (CBR) is proposed. Firstly, for accurate extraction
of DfRem targets, VSM is employed to extract customer demand data
features from the mass customer demand data embedded with
remanufacturing information, and K-means technique is applied to
classify customer demand data features thus to extract DfRem targets.
After extraction of DfRem targets, CBR is utilized to retrieve the case
that is most similar to the DfRem targets from DfRem and remanufacturing
process knowledge bases. In order to improve the accuracy of the
retrieval, ontology is used to construct standard knowledge expression.
Finally, this method has been evaluated utilizing the DfRem of clutch
remanufacturing as case studies. The results show that the method can
accurately generate design scheme to satisfy the customer demands. In
this paper, the intelligent DfRem method has been developed by Visual
Studio and Microsoft SQL Server, which can quickly generate the most
suitable solution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ontology-based similarity measures have received much importance in
recent years. In many real-world cases, the domain considered in the
ontological similarity assessment consists of uncertainty or incomplete
information. Such vagueness has led to the successful implementation of
fuzzy ontology (FO)-based similarity measures. Despite various
applications of FO-based similarity measures, limited methods have so
far been proposed for this purpose. Accordingly, this paper presents a
generic model for semantic similarity assessment based on a fuzzy
ontology. The proposed approach relies on the broad literature of Crisp
Ontology-based Structural Semantic Similarity Measures (CO-SSSM). It
provides an approach for mapping CO-SSSMs to fuzzy context.
Consequently, the proposed generic model can be applied to various
CO-SSSMs to develop their corresponding FO-SSSMs. In this regard, as an
empirical investigation, four of the common CO-SSSMs were selected,
their equivalent FO-SSSMs were developed by means of the proposed
approach, and the accuracy of their similarity assessment was compared
with each other. The results show the power of FO-SSSMs in describing
the relations between concepts and their superiority over CO-SSSMs.},

This work aims to study the implantee's visual modal adaptation by analyzing the visual evoked potential. The proposed methodology analyses the existence of cross-modal reorganization in the auditory cortex of bilateral prelingually deaf children after cochlear implantation using visual evoked potential. Fifty healthy, 50 prelingually, deaf children 50 cochlear implanted were considered as a cohort of the Visual evoked potential. The evoked potential recorded using pattern reversal stimulation. The amplitude and latency of N75, P100, and N145 components show a significant difference in normal, cochlear, and deaf.

its influence on different types of industries mean that human-robot
cooperation is of special importance. Various types of robots have been
applied to the so-called field of Edutainment, i.e., the field that
combines education with entertainment. This paper introduces a novel
fuzzy-based system for a human-robot cooperative Edutainment. This
co-learning system includes a brain-computer interface (BCI) ontology
model and a Fuzzy Markup Language (FML)-based Reinforcement Learning
Agent (FRL-Agent). The proposed FRL-Agent is composed of (1) a human
learning agent, (2) a robotic teaching agent, (3) a Bayesian estimation
agent, (4) a robotic BCI agent, (5) a fuzzy machine learning agent, and
(6) a fuzzy BCI ontology. In order to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed system, the FRL-Agent is used as a robot teacher in a number of
elementary schools, junior high schools, and at a university to allow
robot teachers and students to learn together in the classroom. The
participated students use handheld devices to indirectly or directly
interact with the robot teachers to learn English. Additionally, a
number of university students wear a commercial EEG device with eight
electrode channels to learn English and listen to music. In the
experiments, the robotic BCI agent analyzes the collected signals from
the EEG device and transforms them into five physiological indices when
the students are learning or listening. The Bayesian estimation agent
and fuzzy machine learning agent optimize the parameters of the FRL
agent and store them in the fuzzy BCI ontology. The experimental results
show that the robot teachers motivate students to learn and stimulate
their progress. The fuzzy machine learning agent is able to predict the
five physiological indices based on the eight-channel EEG data and the
trained model. In addition, we also train the model to predict the other
students' feelings based on the analyzed physiological indices and
labeled feelings. The FRL agent is able to provide personalized learning
content based on the developed human and robot cooperative edutainment
approaches. To our knowledge, the FRL agent has not applied to the
teaching fields such as elementary schools before and it opens up a
promising new line of research in human and robot co-learning. In the
future, we hope the FRL agent will solve such an existing problem in the
classroom that the high-performing students feel the learning contents
are too simple to motivate their learning or the low-performing students
are unable to keep up with the learning progress to choose to give up
learning.},

procedure. Next, an instrumental experiment is realised for measuring
the technical parameters of fabrics and five sensory experiments are
carried out in order to acquire design knowledge. The acquired data are
used to classify body shapes and model the relations between human
bodies, fashion themes and design factors by using fuzzy techniques.
From these models, we set up an ontology-based design knowledge base,
including key data and relevant relation models. This knowledge base can
be updated in a big data environment by progressively learning from new
design cases. On this basis, we propose an interactive, personalised
design recommender system. This system works through a newly proposed
design process: consumers' emotional requirement identification - design
schemes generation - recommender - 3D virtual prototype display and
evaluation - design factors adjustment. This process can be performed
repeatedly until the designer is satisfied. The proposed system has been
validated through a number of successful real design cases. (c) 2020

abstract = {According to the latest statistics, the proportion of the elderly (+65)
is increasing and is expected to double within the European Union in a
period of 50 years. This ageing is due to the improvement of quality of
life and advances in medicine in the last decades. Gerontechnology is
receiving a great deal of attention as a way of providing the elderly
with sustainable products, environments, and services combining
gerontology and technology. One of the most important aspects to
consider by gerontechnology is the mobility/rehabilitation technologies,
because there is an important relationship between mobility and the
elderly's quality of life. Telerehabilitation systems have emerged to
allow the elderly to perform their rehabilitation exercises remotely.
However, in many cases, the proposed systems assist neither the patients
nor the experts about the progress of the rehabilitation. To address
this problem, we propose in this paper, a fuzzy-semantic system for
evaluating patient's physical state during the rehabilitation process
based on well-known standard for patients' evaluation. Moreover, a tool
called FINE has been developed that facilitates the evaluation be
accomplished in a semi-automatic way first asking patients to carry out
a set of standard tests and then inferencing their state by means of a
fuzzy-semantic approach using the data captured during the
rehabilitation tasks.},

abstract = {The purpose of this extension of the ESM'2019 conference paper is to
propose some means to implement an artificial thinking model that
simulates human psychological behavior. The first necessary model is the
time fuzzy vector space model (TFVS). Traditional fuzzy logic uses
fuzzification/defuzzification, fuzzy rules and implication to assess and
combine several significant attributes to make deductions. The
originality of TFVS is not to be another fuzzy logic model but rather a
fuzzy object-oriented model which implements a dynamic object
structural, behavior analogy and which encapsulates time fuzzy vectors
in the object components and their attributes. The second model is a
fuzzy vector space object oriented model and method (FVSOOMM) that
describes how-to realize step by step the appropriate TFVS from the
ontology class diagram designed with the Unified Modeling Language
(UML). The third contribution concerns the cognitive model (Emotion,
Personality, Interactions, Knowledge (Connaissance) and Experience)
EPICE the layers of which are necessary to design the features of the
artificial thinking model (ATM). The findings are that the TFVS model
provides the appropriate time modelling tools to design and implement
the layers of the EPICE model and thus the cognitive pyramids of the
ATM. In practice, the emotion of cognitive dissonance during buying
decisions is proposed and a game addiction application depicts the gamer
decision process implementation with TFVS and finite state automata.
Future works propose a platform to automate the implementation of TFVS
according to the steps of the FVSOOMM method. An application is a
case-based reasoning temporal approach based on TFVS and on dynamic
distances computing between time resultant vectors in order to assess
and compare similar objects' evolution. The originality of this work is
to provide models, tools and a method to design and implement some
features of an artificial thinking model.},

abstract = {In recent years, unmanned vehicles (UVs) have been largely employed in
many applications. They, enhanced with computer vision and artificial
intelligence, can autonomously recognize targets in an environment and
detect events occurring in a real-world scenario. The employment of
cooperative UVs can provide multiple interpretations supporting a
multiperspective view of the scene. However, UV multiple interpretations
often diverge, therefore, UVs need to find an agreed interpretation of
the scenario. To this purpose, this paper proposes a novel
consensus-based approach to lead multi-UV systems to find agreement on
what they observe and build a group situation-based description of the
scenario. UVs are modeled as experts in a group decision making problem
that must decide on which situations best describe the scenario. First,
the approach allows each UV to build high-level situations from the
detected events through a fuzzy-based event aggregation. The event
aggregation is modeled with a fuzzy ontology which allows each UV to
express preferences on the situations. Then, a collective interpretation
of situations is achieved by consensing each UV interpretation. Finally,
consensus and proximity measures support the evaluation of the final
group decision reliability. The assessed consensus reflects how much the
collective scenario interpretation fits each UV perspective. The
proximity measures support the detection of reliable and unreliable UVs
to serve many tasks (i.e., mission replanning, damaged UV detection,
etc.).},

abstract = {Traditional methodology for pile integrity evaluation usually adopts
fuzzy qualitative indicators and the engineering experience of
technicians to roughly estimate the integrity category of a pile, which
includes many uncertainties and heavily subjective factors. Therefore,
based on an analytical model for the vibration of pile and an
ontology-based approach, this paper describes the development of an
integrated evaluation system that can make reasonable evaluations of
pile integrity where specific measured reflective wave curves are
provided. First, a semi-analytical solution for the velocity response of
pile with defects at the pile head was derived by analytical
methodology, and then the intrinsic relationships between the
quantitative indicators of pile defects and the characteristic
parameters of velocity response curves were obtained according to the
propagation law of elastic wave and the numerical fitting method. On
this basis, a prototypical ontology-based evaluation system, ontology of
pile integrity evaluation (OntoPIE), with a new ontology framework of
leverage knowledge modelling was developed to create an easy-to-use tool
for quantitative identification of pile defects and qualitative
evaluation of pile integrity by combining ontology and semantic web rule
language (SWRL) rules. A case study was also conducted to show how the
developed framework can be used to demonstrate its practicability and
scientific feasibility. The accuracy of the framework will be verified
by comparing the quantitative indicators of pile defects inferred by
OntoPIE with the preset defect indicators through designed examples.},

These can have a negative impact on several areas and on our minds, hence on our behavior. It is obvious that this disinformation is closely related to the profiles of the authors of this information. The purpose of author profiling is to analyze the texts published by the authors in order to determine their profile category. A wide range of methods for selecting statistical characteristics and machine learning has been studied in recent years in order to automatically classify this information. However, these main methods of selecting statistical characteristics and machine learning used for this purpose have not proven their great performance in the processing of data from social networks. The main contribution of this article consists in integrating the semantic component, which has not been taken into account in the main approaches studied in the literature, as additional functionalities enabling the identification of relevant information. Our hypothesis is that the concepts and the relationships between these concepts tend to have a more coherent correlation with relevant and irrelevant information, and can therefore increase the discriminating power of classifiers. The semantic approach proposed revolves around an ontology combined with the linear SVM classifier and then with the fuzzy SVM classifier. The experimental study carried out, on the different collections of Twitter profiles. On our approach and on the main approaches to the literature that we have studied, as well as the analysis of the results obtained. The results we have clearly show the limits of these studied approaches and confirm the performance of our approach, as well as the efficiency of the integration of the semantic component in the categorization of Twitter profiles.},

E-commerce characteristics, including time-critical delivery, fragmented orders, and high product variety, should be further considered to extend the ontology of multi-temperature joint distribution. However, traditional delivery route planning is insufficient because it merely minimises the cost of travelling between customer locations. Factors related to food quality and arrival time windows should also be considered. In addition, handling dynamic incident management, such as violations of handling requirements during delivery, is lacking. This leads to the likelihood of food deteriorating before it reaches the consumers, thereby impacting customer satisfaction. This paper proposes an Internet of Things-based multi-temperature delivery planning system (IoT-MTDPS), embedding a two-phase multi-objective genetic algorithm optimiser (2PMGAO). The formulation of delivery routing mainly considers product-dependent multi-temperature characteristics, service level, transportation cost, and number of trucks. Once there are unexpected incidents which are detected by Internet of Things technologies, 2PMGAO can optimise the membership functions of fuzzy logic for re-routing the e-commerce delivery plan. With using IoT-MTDPS, the capability of handling e-commerce orders is enhanced, while customer satisfaction can be maintained at a designated level.},

(CAD) model (e.g. hierarchical constraints, geometric constraints and

This paper aims to improve monotonous assembly sequence planning for a
rigid product, intelligent planning of product assembly sequences based
on spatio-temporal semantic knowledge is proposed.
Design/methodology/approach A spatio-temporal semantic assembly
information model is established. The internal data of the CAD model are
accessed to extract spatio-temporal semantic assembly information. The
knowledge system for assembly sequence intelligent planning is built
using an ontology model. The assembly sequence for the sub-assembly and
assembly is generated via attribute retrieval and rule reasoning of
spatio-temporal semantic knowledge. The optimal assembly sequence is
achieved via a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. Findings The proposed
spatio-temporal semantic information model and knowledge system can
simultaneously express CAD model knowledge and prior knowledge for
intelligent planning of product assembly sequences. Attribute retrieval
and rule reasoning of spatio-temporal semantic knowledge can be used to
generate product assembly sequences. Practical implications The assembly
sequence intelligent planning example of linear motor highlights the
validity of intelligent planning of product assembly sequences based on

spatio-temporal semantic information model and knowledge system are
built to simultaneously express CAD model knowledge and assembly prior

this study, an expert system was developed based on the mathematical
apparatus of the theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, which can take

significantly reduce the examination time and improve the quality of the
diagnostics. A hierarchical structure of the organization of expert

possibility of its expansion based on ontological analysis. Moreover, a
technique was developed for formalizing expert information using
membership functions for input and output control parameters. To
implement a fuzzy logical inference, an algorithm adapted to the given

implements the method of identification of the category of technical

In QAOC architecture, the components involved are query manager, scheduler and data management. Initially the query manager consolidates the query if they are similar; hereby the searching time is effectively minimized. Then the user query is scheduled in neuro-fuzzy by computing query arrival time, query length and query expiry time. The data management in the back-end is operated by weighted ontology-based clustering method to cluster the data based on their relevancy. The scheduled user query is searched in the ontology based balanced binary tree and lastly the relevant results are ranked using Okapi BM25 and delivered to user. This QAOC architecture is experimented on Hadoop 2.7 and the results are compared in terms of execution time, processing speed and memory consumption.},

any restriction, the trustworthiness of the content creator plays an
important role before using the content. An effective way to find the
trustworthiness is, by analyzing the web resources related to the
content creator. Therefore the trustworthiness is assessed using the
provenance based ontological model called W7 model. Since it is a real
time data, the computed trust for each reviewer using the ontological
model is uncertain and vague. An appropriate way to classify such data
is using the fuzzy logic with gradual trust level. As the computed trust
data are feature-based and non-symbolic, the classification ambiguity
need to be reduced greatly. This is achieved with the fuzzy decision
tree approach, which is a fusion of fuzzy sets with decision tree. The
truth of the rule is crucial in trustworthy user classification, as
highly truthful rules really increase the credibility of the user in
their domain. Therefore, in the proposed model, degree of truth is used
as a pruning criteria that classifies the users with minimum number of
fuzzy evidence or knowledge. This paper proposes a semantic provenance
based gradual trust model to classify the trustworthy reviewers in a
book-based social networks using fuzzy decision tree approach.
Performance analysis of the proposed model in the terms of classifier
accuracy, precision, recall, the number of rules generated and its time
complexity are discussed. The analysis shows that the proposed learning
model outperforms other classification models. This method is also
applied to other data sets and the performance of the classifier is

abstract = {The high spread of Internet and social networks have completely changed the way that Group Decision Making methods are designed, developed and implemented. Experts now operate in environments where a large amount of information is available and new ideas and participants can appear at any time; this results in a dynamically changing decision environment. In this paper, a novel group decision making method for dynamic contexts with a high number of decision alternatives is presented. As the main component of the proposal, a perceptual computing scheme is used in order to extract information from the experts. In the process, sentiment analysis is used when analyzing the debate texts in order to obtain information for selecting the best alternatives on each round. Moreover, interval type-2 hesitant Fuzzy Ontologies are used in order to store the information related to alternatives. By combining interval type-2 and hesitant fuzzy sets, imprecise information can be represented in a comfortable and intuitive way within the ontology.},
